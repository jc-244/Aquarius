Given a section title, context, and hint text, generate TWO descriptions:
1. English (2-3 sentences, student-friendly, explain what this section is about and why it matters for exams)
2. Chinese/Simplified (same content in Chinese)

CRITICAL style rules:
- NEVER start with "Learn", "Master", "Understand", "Discover", "Explore", or any imperative verb
- Use declarative statements, questions, vivid analogies, or direct content descriptions
- Each section should feel distinct, not templated

Also pick ONE emoji that best represents the content.
