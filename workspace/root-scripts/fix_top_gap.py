# Problem 1: Earlier I set `margin-top: 40px !important;` on `.search-box` which pushed it, 
# But the HUGE gap on top is likely due to the welcome-inner style setting from earlier being left over or conflicting flex-alignments.
# Or wait, .main has "margin-top: 8px;".
# Ah, earlier in "finish_style.py" I added:
# .welcome-inner { height: 100%; padding-top: 15vh !important; justify-content: flex-start !important; }
# This was for the centered version, and it's shoving the left-right layout 15vh down!

# In index.html, welcomeScreen has "position: absolute; inset: 0;"
# BUT! The `.main` container or the main wrapper might be stretching due to flex issues, or we lost `.app`'s layout.
# Let's ensure `.welcome` fills it cleanly without a massive overhead gap.
