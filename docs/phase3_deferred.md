# Phase 3 — Deferred Items

Drafted: 2026-06-21, end of the Phase 3 implementation session that landed
6 PRs / commits (PR #21, baseline refresh, PR #22, PR #20a, PR #20b, PR #20c).
Lists everything intentionally left unfinished, with the rationale and a
suggested next-session entry point. Use this as the starting point for
"Phase 3.5" (or fold the largest items into Phase 4 scoping).

## 1. PR #21 follow-ups

### 1a. Pass 2 — shared interactive-demos helpers

**Status: shipped 2026-06-22 in PR #59 (82d4ade).**

`app/interactive-demos/helpers.js` created. Three free-name helpers
extracted across complex-plane / sinusoid-phasor / phasor + the
chapter-one demo rerender in app.js:

- `applyCanvasDpr(canvas, ctx, width, height)` — replaces the
  shared dpr+setTransform tail of each family's `sizeCanvas`.
- `drawCanvasArrow(ctx, x1, y1, x2, y2, color, opts)` — reconciles
  the three divergent `drawArrow` closures. `opts.headLength`
  defaults to 10 (sinusoid/phasor); complex-plane passes 11.
- `coalesceFrames(callback)` — replaces the `pendingFrame` rAF
  coalesce pattern.

**Plan-inventory correction:** the original §1a estimate of "~600
lines net delete" was wildly aspirational. Realistic measurement:

| File | Before | After | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| complex-plane.js | 291 | 261 | −30 |
| sinusoid-phasor.js | 292 | 266 | −26 |
| phasor.js | 323 | 295 | −28 |
| app.js (chapter-one rerender) | — | — | −8 |
| helpers.js | 0 | 72 | +72 |
| **Net** |  |  | **−18** |

The 600-line estimate counted full per-family closure consolidation
across 4 modules (including `matrix-conformability.js`), but the
following did NOT consolidate per-family divergence is intentional:

- `formatNum` / `formatValue` precision (toFixed 3 vs 2)
- `getA` / `getB` / `getThetaRad` / `getC` defaults + sign
  conventions (phasor flips b via `atan2(-b, a)`)
- `sizeCanvas` width/height calc (min 320 / 180 / 160; height-from-
  width vs fallback-height vs parent-padding subtraction)
- `drawGrid` (single-use in sinusoid-phasor)
- Control-wiring loop (per-family CSS class names —
  parameterization exceeds savings)
- `matrix-conformability.js` (no canvas helpers at all — only
  shares the broader control-wiring loop pattern)

The structural win is **one-place-to-change** for future `drawArrow`
/ dpr tweaks, not the line count.

**Harness gap (recorded for future work):** the visual-diff harness
covers `convolution_lab` + `pole_zero_roc_lab` family keys only.
The 3 modified families (`complex_plane`, `sinusoid_phasor_projection`,
`phasor`) are NOT pixel-verified by the harness. Save/restore behavior
of `drawCanvasArrow` is benign because every post-`drawArrow` callsite
in sinusoid/phasor explicitly resets fillStyle/strokeStyle/lineWidth
before next use (hand-verified in self-review).

### 1b. Dispatcher simplification: 13 family arms → lookup table

**What:** Replace the 13 sequential `if (family === 'X') { renderX(...); return; }`
arms in `hydrateInteractiveDemos` (`app/app.js` L3720-L3792) with a
single lookup table:

```js
const FAMILY_RENDERERS = {
  signal_transform: renderSignalTransformFallback,
  energy_power:     renderEnergyPowerFallback,
  ...
};
const fn = FAMILY_RENDERERS[family];
if (fn) { fn(node, demo); return; }
```

**Why deferred:** Surfaced by PR #21's self-review (Reuse #1). Trivial
mechanical change, but it restructures the dispatcher pattern. Per the
plan's "mechanical move only" Pass-1 philosophy, kept out of #21.
Net delete: ~50 lines.

**Entry point:** drop into `hydrateInteractiveDemos` and replace the
13-arm block. Verify with the visual-diff harness (no chrome change
expected) and the lesson-open-no-hang test.

### 1c. Carry-forward pre-existing bugs in family modules

Surfaced by PR #21's adversarial review. All pre-existing (the
extraction faithfully preserved them). Each is Sev-2 or below:

- **`sinusoid-phasor.js` rAF tick has no detach hook.** Re-hydrating
  a sinusoid section without a full page reload starts a second tick
  loop that races the first. The `if (!node.isConnected) return;`
  guard fires only on detach, not on innerHTML wipe of a still-connected
  node. Real-world trigger rare but possible.
- **`sinusoid-phasor.js` Reset-while-paused freezes the wave at t=0.**
  Reset handler doesn't also set `state.running = true` or update the
  Play/Pause button label. User clicks Pause to inspect, then Reset
  to revert sliders, then the wave never animates again until they
  explicitly click Play.
- **`sinusoid-phasor.js` `updateControlLabels` doesn't null-check
  `querySelector` results.** If a future spec variant omits any of
  the three `data-demo-value` strong elements, throws
  `Cannot set properties of null`.
- **`phasor.js` ignores the dispatcher's `demoControls` fallback chain.**
  Reads `demoSpec.controls` directly; if an author writes a phasor
  demo with controls at the top-level `demo.controls` (with phasor
  panels still in `demoSpec.panels`), controls silently render
  empty with hardcoded defaults `slider_a=1`, `slider_b=-1.732`.
- **`sinusoid-phasor.js` hardcodes amplitude/freq/phase defaults**,
  ignoring authored `demo.controls`/`demoSpec.controls` entirely.
- **All large family modules leak resize listeners.** Per-family
  `window.addEventListener('resize', rerender, { passive: true })`
  is never removed. Pre-existing leak; PR #21 plan explicitly said
  to preserve.

**Why deferred:** All pre-existing; not caused by the refactor. Fixing
them inside #21 would have muddied the diff. Each is small enough
to fit a single follow-up PR but should be batched: one PR per
module (sinusoid, phasor) with explicit `before / after` repro steps.

## 2. PR #22 follow-ups

No deferrals identified. Self-review came back clean. The 2,111-line
CSS extraction is byte-fidelity verified and visual-diff confirmed.

---

## 2b. PR #23 (interactive-demos family lookup) follow-ups

PR #23 (deferred 1b) shipped — the 13 `if (family === 'X')` arms in
`hydrateInteractiveDemos` collapsed into `INTERACTIVE_DEMO_FAMILY_RENDERERS`.
Net `app/app.js` −43 lines. Self-review (4-lens adversarial) approved.

**Harness coverage gap surfaced during review — Sev-1 against future
refactors of this code path, not this PR.** The 9-view visual-diff harness
opens exactly one lesson (1.1-1 Signal Energy), whose only
`kc-interactive-demo` has `demo_type: energy_cross_term`, which is in
`CHAPTER_ONE_DEMO_TYPES`. The dispatcher short-circuits at the
`if (isChapterOneDemo)` branch BEFORE the new lookup is reached. None of
the 13 family keys are exercised by views 06/07/08/09. A typo in any key
(e.g., `pole_zero_roc_lab` → `pole_zero_ROC_lab`) or a renderer-name
mismatch would silently fall through to `renderBriefDemoFallback` and
visual-diff would still report 0.000% green. PR #23 was confirmed safe
by hand-walking all 13 mappings against `app/interactive-demos/*.js`
function declarations during review; future PRs touching this code MUST
NOT rely on visual-diff alone.

**Entry point for harness expansion:** add a 10th view that opens a
Chapter-2+ subtopic whose primary demo's `family` is one of the 13
table keys (e.g., a `convolution_lab` or `pole_zero_roc_lab` subtopic
with a cached lesson). Then this code path becomes regression-covered.
The user has explicitly scheduled visual-diff harness expansion as the
next session focus.

Secondary nits (Sev-3, not in this PR):
- Optional `Object.create(null)` for the table (prototype-pollution
  hardening). Today safe — `inferInteractiveDemoFamily` returns a closed
  enum of literal strings, none collide with `Object.prototype`.
- Optional registry module extraction (`app/interactive-demos/registry.js`).
  Defers an eventual interactive-demos subsystem extraction (Phase 2 #18
  candidate per §5).
- The 6 non-table family values that legitimately miss the lookup are
  fully handled elsewhere in the dispatcher — coverage is complete:
  - `opposite_rotations` — `isOppositeRotationDemo` branch ABOVE the lookup.
  - `complex_plane` — `isComplexPlaneDemo` branch ABOVE.
  - `sinusoid` — `isSinusoidDemo` branch ABOVE.
  - `matrix_conformability` — final unconditional
    `renderMatrixConformabilityDemo` after the `!isMatrixDemo` check.
  - `algebra_brief` and `brief` — `renderBriefDemoFallback` via the
    `!isMatrixDemo` branch.
  Not documented in-code per project style; this entry is the record.

## 3. PR #20a/b/c Pass 2 follow-ups (the bulk of the deferred work)

The original plan §6 target for PR #20 was **~5,600 net lines deleted**
across 3 sub-PRs. Pass 1 work shipped delivered **165 lines** (#20a 131 +
#20b 14 + #20c 20). The remaining **~5,400 lines** are in Pass 2
work that requires per-property override-chain analysis.

### 3a. PR #20a Pass 2 — lesson + lecture surface override collapse

**Status (2026-06-22): partially complete.** Step B in the
`REFACTOR_PLAN.md` roadmap shipped 5 sections (S1+S2+S3+S4+S6+wrap-up)
plus the original plan target was rescoped after discovery work
surfaced that the 1,200-line plan estimate was structurally
unreachable. Deferred follow-ups: §3a.i (S5 feedback-tones — the
5-banner cascade analysis described below) and §3a.ii (B25 textbook
mode lock + remaining low/medium-confidence cluster-G findings).

#### What shipped in Step B (Pass 2, 2026-06-22)

- **PR #46 — S1 title-scale collapse** — delete byte-identical
  duplicate banner (11 lines).
- **PR #47 — S2 sidebar-home icon collapse** — 3 banners (B14/B16/B24)
  → 1 base + 1 minimal state-variant. Caught a dead-code finding:
  B24's gradient + colored box-shadow on the icon never rendered
  (B14's higher-spec `:not(.active)` resets always won). Synthesis's
  "preserve every property mention" generator was wrong; correct
  collapse drops the dead gradient (24 lines).
- **PR #48 — S3 Q&A docked container merge** — fold B8 container-type
  + container-name into B7 (6 lines).
- **PR #49 — S4 mistake-notebook duplicate cleanup** — INVERTED from
  the synthesis's recommended direction. B28's doubled-ID
  `#mistakeNotebookView#mistakeNotebookView` (2, 1, 0) is actively
  beating the LATER liquid-glass-redesign rules at L36408+ which set
  a 2-column grid, different margin-top, different alignment. The
  actual dead code is B30 (single-ID, every property either
  identical to B28 or overridden by B28 at higher spec). 84 lines.
- **PR #50 — S6 BOOK SURFACE cascade dedup** — 4 of 5 high-confidence
  cluster-G findings (3 dead declarations in B2 already losing to B5
  in the cascade, 1 dead `.lecture-overlay-btn` selector in B5, 1
  longhand-shorthand redundancy in B5, 1 duplicate disabled/hidden
  rule in B6) (20 lines).
- **PR #51 — Step B wrap-up** — final cluster-G finding B15 [1]
  (#learnViewSelector margin-right superseded by B17's margin shorthand)
  + this doc refresh + project memory bump (4 lines).

**Cumulative Step B delta: ~169 lines deleted, not the 1,200 plan
estimate.**

#### Why the 1,200-line plan target proved unreachable

The plan §6.1 target was set before per-property timeline analysis
revealed the structure of the cluster:
- Pass 1 (#40/#41/#42) already shipped 165 lines of orphan deletes —
  the easy wins were already taken before Pass 2 started.
- L33581 LEARN Q&A RUNTIME INJECTION OVERRIDE banner (~90 lines) was
  deferred §3d, removing it from the available pool.
- Banner 32 (Preference page liquid glass) starts at L35828, not
  L35958. The plan's L35958 line cutoff was off by ~130 lines.
- Most "duplicates" in this cluster are NOT byte-identical — they are
  banners at different specificities defending against each other's
  later overrides. The cascade is structurally load-bearing in many
  places that look duplicated on selector-text inspection alone.
- The 7-cluster discovery missed cross-banner interactions with the
  LATER #20b range (L36408+ for mistake-notebook, L38504+ for
  feedback tones). Two of the originally proposed S4/S5 sections
  needed direction inversion (S4 shipped inverted) or full deferral
  (S5).

Realistic Step B ceiling, post-analysis: ~320 lines if all 5 sections
shipped + a polished S5. The 880-line gap to the original 1,200 target
is structural, not a deferral.

#### 3a.i — SHIPPED PR #71: S5 feedback-author-tones (-95 lines)

Per-property cascade walk of L34000–L39200 via dispatched workflow
(109 agents, 1080 declarations tagged, 94 candidates → 23 confirmed-safe
blocks → 22 blocks shipped after adversarial review caught one false-
positive). Initial squash-merge (bc03542) deleted 95 lines net; the
PR description listed a projected 103 but a (1,4,0) selector restore
landed mid-review (see "Regression caught + fixed" below).

**Regression caught + fixed.** The cascade-analysis workflow flagged
L34742-L34748 as a duplicate of L34825-L34829 — true ONLY for the
single (1,3,0) selector `.feedback-reply[class*="tone-"]
.feedback-reply-context`. The (1,4,0) selectors at L34743/L34744
(`.is-left[class*="tone-"] .feedback-reply-context` + `.is-right`
variant) were UNIQUELY defined and had no later duplicate. Deleting
them dropped the cascade to two (1,3,0) candidates — the preserved
tone-tint L34775 and the lane-lock at L37725 (FEEDBACK CONVERSATION
COLOR LANES). Source-order tiebreak went to L37725 — chip border
flipped from `rgba(var(--author-rgb), 0.22)` (tone-tinted teal/orange)
to `rgba(52,211,153,0.34)` (lane green) / `rgba(244,114,182,0.32)`
(lane pink). Background and color shifted analogously. Restored in
commit 8d8bce6 with a load-bearing DO-NOT-DELETE comment.

**Visual-diff harness FAILED to catch the regression.** The harness
reported 14b at 0/1024000 pixels diff across two `--check` runs.
A diagnostic test with `border: 5px solid magenta + background: yellow`
on `.feedback-reply-context` also slipped past as 0%. The harness
DOES detect total-removal changes (`display: none` produced 2.821%
diff on view 14), so the bug is property/selector-specific, NOT
total-blindness — possibly a Playwright/Chromium CSS-loading or
disk-cache issue. **Direct Playwright computed-style probe was the
load-bearing verification** for §3a.i (see docs/visual-diff-harness-
gap.md if filed). All future #feedbackView CSS-cascade work MUST
use direct computed-style probes until the harness gap is fixed.

**Discovery-agent scoping lesson confirmed.** The deferred-doc warning
"discovery agents stop at the cluster's banner boundary" turned out
to be the wrong threat model. The actual failure mode was: workflow
correctly walked the full L34000-L39200 range, found L34825 as the
"byte-identical duplicate" — but failed to verify that the deleted
RULE GROUP contained two (1,4,0) selectors that the duplicate at
L34825 did NOT carry. The byte-identical check passed at the rule
level but not the selector level. Future cascade-analysis prompts
should explicitly compare comma-separated selector lists, not just
declaration bodies, when claiming "duplicate."

**Forward cleanup status (2026-06-24):**

- **L37980-L37991 tone-0..5 `--author-rgb`/`--author-ink` triplicate:**
  ALREADY REMOVED by PRs #80/#81 cleanup of the feedback cluster — only
  one definition set at L34710-L34715 remains in the post-#83 file.
  No further work.
- **L38006 `.feedback-reply-meta` tone-aware:** SHIPPED PR #87 (2026-06-24).
  Dropped `#feedbackView .feedback-reply[class*="tone-"] .feedback-reply-meta`
  from the L34655 grouped selector (byte-identical to L37790's first
  selector, same 1,2,1 spec, source-order shadow). Also bundled: L29817
  `font-size: 12px !important` dropped (byte-identical to L37088 same-group
  same-spec). −2 lines net.
- **L34751-L34762 4-selector deletes:** ALREADY REMOVED by PR #80
  (§3b.i `.feedback-reply.is-left::before { right: auto !important }`
  + L34786 `.feedback-reply-context` triple-group) and PR #81
  (`.feedback-thread` zero-match selector + remaining triple-group).
  The comma-group atomic-delete tooling was never needed because the
  enclosing rules became fully-shadowed and were deletable as full
  blocks. No further work.

#### 3a.ii — SHIPPED PR #76 (2026-06-24): B17/B18/B25 cluster-G remnants (-11 lines)

- **B25 (Textbook mode lock) — SHIPPED.** The `background:` shorthand
  at L34982-34985 was deleted. Inside the same rule, the surviving
  `background-image:` longhand at L34986-34989 carries the identical
  gradient list at identical `!important` weight, winning the image
  leg by source order. The shorthand's implicit color/position/repeat/
  size/origin/clip resets fall through to the lower-specificity
  `background:` shorthands at L32942 + L33583, which apply the same
  resets in both `.learn-textbook-active` and
  `.chapter-overview-active.learn-textbook-active` states.
  Code-smell note for future textbook-lock edits: pick shorthand-only
  OR longhand-only, not both — carrying both in one rule was the exact
  pattern that produced this dead code. 4 lines net.
- **B15 [2]:** `.learn-topbar-actions:has(#learnClose.learn-close)`
  rule looked dead because `#learnClose { display: none }`, but
  `#learnClose` IS rendered in the DOM (HTML L629; JS at app.js:891
  + 5334 wires it), so `:has()` still matches. NOT a delete.
- **B17 [1] — SHIPPED (1 of 9).** L25982-L25983 dead `:not()` selectors
  in the `#learnViewSelector` grouped rule were deleted. The third
  co-selector `#learnView #learnViewSelector` matches every instance
  unconditionally because `#learnViewSelector` lives in
  `.learn-topbar-actions` (sibling of `#learnBody` per `index.html:625`
  + `app.js:943-946`), so the two `#learnBody`-descendant selectors
  match zero elements in every DOM state. 2 lines net.
- **B17 extension — SHIPPED PR #77 (2026-06-24).** Remaining 8 sites of
  the same dead-`:not()` pattern cleared: L20731, L26114, L26175, L26243,
  L26416, L26616, L26672, L26956 (post-PR-#76 line numbers). Two sites
  live inside `@container lecture-panel (max-width: 760px)` queries
  (L20731 + L26114); the rest are top-level. All grep occurrences of
  `#learnBody:not(.chapter-overview-active) #learnViewSelector` and
  `.chapter-overview-split-active #learnViewSelector` in the file are
  now gone. Visual-diff harness 28 views: runs 2+3 stable, all pass.
  Run 1 view-22 0.765% flake confirmed to be Glass-card text-glyph
  anti-aliasing via diff-PNG inspection (not topbar). 16 lines net.
- **B18 [1] — SHIPPED.** L34702-L34705 deleted. Same selector
  (`.welcome.home-ask-workspace #homeModeMenu .home-mode-menu-icon i`),
  same specificity (0,1,3,1), both `!important`, both top-level (verified
  no enclosing `@media`) — L40073's `font-size: 22px` wins by source
  order over the deleted `font-size: 24px`. `line-height: 1` is
  covered by unitless inheritance from the parent `.home-mode-menu-icon`
  at L34689 (still live, `!important`). Doc B18's mention of L39324/
  L40268/L40829 was based on stale line numbers — only 2 occurrences
  existed at PR time, not 4. 4 lines net.

**Discovery-agent scoping lesson:** for any banner-cluster discovery,
the property-timeline analysis must walk the cascade to file end, not
stop at the cluster's banner boundary. Both the cluster-E and cluster-C
discovery missed cross-banner overrides outside the cluster range.
Future Step C / Step D discovery prompts should explicitly require
"grep the full file for every selector before declaring a rule dead."

### 3b. PR #20b Pass 2 — preference + MN + course-tracker + feedback-board

**Status (2026-06-22, late session): partially complete.** Step C shipped
4 sub-PRs (#52/#53/#54/#55) totalling **−123 lines** in `app/style.css`,
all visual-diff-verified at 0.000% on all 18 baseline views.

#### What shipped in Step C

- **PR #52 — S1 feedback-thread tone-background dedup** — delete
  byte-identical duplicate of `#feedbackView .feedback-thread[class*="tone-"]
  { background: ... }` between the two "EOF FEEDBACK AUTHOR COLORS" and
  "TRUE FINAL FEEDBACK AUTHOR TONES" banners (6 lines incl. blank).
- **PR #53 — S2 course-tracker originals superseded by redesign** —
  delete `.course-tracker-stat-value` + `span:last-child` (unused),
  `.course-tracker-stat-card, .course-tracker-card` background/border
  group + padding group (overridden by L36989/L37147 with !important),
  `.course-tracker-table-wrap` (replaced by `.course-tracker-timeline`
  in redesign) (37 lines).
- **PR #54 — S3 Mistake Notebook tail dead overrides** — delete
  horizontal-split layout using never-wired `--mistake-note-left/--right`,
  `min-height: 150px` overridden by `210px` 30 lines later, mobile
  `@media` block byte-identical to a sibling 17 lines later (29 lines).
- **PR #55 — S4 Preference PIN LOCK + save-state tones** — delete
  `.preference-profile-card .preference-card-tape` overridden by
  `#preferenceView .preference-card-tape { display: none !important }`
  at L35781, and unscoped `.preference-save-state[data-tone="*"]`
  variants overridden by `#preferenceView`-scoped rules at L35830+
  (51 lines incl. banner).

**Cumulative Step C delta: −123 lines (plan target was ~900).**

#### Why the 900-line plan target proved unreachable

Same structural-ceiling pattern as Step B (#20a Pass 2 hit 169 vs
1,200 target). Per-property cascade analysis surfaced:

- Pass 1 (#41) had already harvested orphan deletes from this range
  (14 lines), removing the easy wins before Pass 2 started.
- Most "duplicate" rules in the cluster are NOT dead — they defend
  against later overrides at higher specificity. The 4 surfaces have
  bona-fide redesign passes (liquid-glass, glass refresh, glass
  intensity, etc.) where the cascade is structurally load-bearing.
- The harness coverage gate (resting state only — Roadmap matrix
  Step C explicitly notes :hover / :disabled / :focus on
  `.feedback-board-card` 27×, `.preference-profile-preview` 18×,
  `.preference-preview-card` 14×, `.preference-primary-btn` 10× are
  NOT covered) blocks roughly 60–70% of the candidate pool.
- Tripled byte-identical duplications (e.g. `.feedback-reply[class*="tone-"]::before`
  at L34909 / L34992 / L38513) require coordinated banner-consolidation
  refactoring, not simple per-rule delete; discovery flagged these as
  needing more cascade reasoning than safe within a single Pass-2 PR.

Realistic Step C ceiling, post-analysis: ~125 lines for the no-state-variant
no-banner-rewrite subset. The 775-line gap to the original 900 target is
structural (harness gap + banner-rewrite complexity), not a deferral.

#### 3b.i — SHIPPED PR #80 (2026-06-24): feedback-cluster shadowed-block cleanup (-48 lines)

The original §3b.i scope (banner-rewrite of "EOF FEEDBACK AUTHOR COLORS"
+ "TRUE FINAL FEEDBACK AUTHOR TONES" + "EOF FEEDBACK AUTHOR COLORS
duplicate at L38480") was obsoleted by interim PRs #71-#79: the third
"duplicate at L38480" banner had already been removed, and the
"TRUE FINAL FEEDBACK AUTHOR TONES" banner was retitled / consolidated.
The remaining work surfaced as 6 individual cascade-shadowed blocks
inside the L34660-L34858 cluster, not a coordinated banner rewrite.

PR #80 deleted 6 shadowed blocks (line numbers pre-deletion):

- L34676-L34682 `#feedbackView .feedback-reply.tone-0..5` per-author
  vars — strict duplicate of broader L34772-L34777 `.tone-0..5`.
  Specificity drops (1,2,0) → (1,1,0); values byte-identical so final
  computed value on every reply is unchanged.
- L34706-L34710 `.feedback-reply[class*="tone-"] .feedback-reply-context`
  single-sel — strict subset of the load-bearing L34668 triple-group.
- L34712-L34716 `.feedback-thread::after` width/background — shadowed
  by L34690 `[class*="tone-"]` at (1,2,1) since every thread per
  app.js:6276 has `tone-N`.
- L34786-L34790 `.feedback-thread::after` width/background/opacity —
  same shadow chain as L34712; opacity falls through to L37552's 0.82.
- L34805-L34814 `.feedback-reply::before` single-sel — every property
  duplicated by L34725 triple-group; L37384's later `display:none`
  made the bare hypothetical unreachable.
- L34852-L34858 `@media (max-width:760px)` block — byte-identical
  (verified via `diff`) to L34754 + L37678; third copy still present.

Verification: per-property cascade walk + 3-lens adversarial review
(specificity-tuple-arithmetic, JS-template-class-discovery, media-query-
and-pseudo-element-edge-cases) — all 6 candidates returned `safe-delete`
with zero refutations. Plus 9-angle high-effort `/code-review` with
1-vote verify + sweep — 4 returned findings, all PR-description precision
asks or runtime-unreachable hypotheticals, no defects. Visual-diff
harness: 33 views @ 0.000% across two consecutive `--check` runs,
including strict-0.05% view 14c (the §3a.i regression-detector).

#### 3b.i.followup — SHIPPED PR #82 (2026-06-24): banner-comment hardening (+13 lines)

Review finding #2 (PR #80 `/code-review`): the L34660-L34667
"EOF FEEDBACK AUTHOR COLORS" banner comment carries a DO-NOT-DELETE
warning specifically about the (1,4,0) `.feedback-reply-context`
triple-group at L34668-L34674, but does not mention the surviving
`.feedback-reply::before` triple-group immediately below
(at L34705 post-deletion / L34725 pre-deletion). A future maintainer
inspecting the cluster could misread the `.feedback-reply::before` group
as accidentally retained and delete it, breaking the dot-marker chrome
on left/right reply pseudo-elements.

**Why deferred (D1 — Unrelated):** the `.feedback-reply::before` group
was not modified by PR #80; expanding the banner comment to cover
adjacent rules is scope creep relative to the cascade-collapse goal of
the PR.

**Next-session entry point:** `app/style.css:34660` — add a brief
"plus the .feedback-reply::before group at L34705 is the live source
of dot-marker chrome" line to the existing DO-NOT-DELETE block. ≤5
line doc-only edit; no cascade impact.

**Update (2026-06-24, post-PR-#81):** the 9-angle `/code-review` of
PR #81 surfaced 6 additional comment-hardening / formatting concerns
on the same feedback + mistake-notebook cluster, all on pre-existing
untouched code. **Bundle these together as the same D1 follow-up:**

- `app/style.css:34660` — banner comment doesn't cross-reference
  L37552-L37562 lane-color overrides (only mentions L37452 in older
  language). Add: "The (1,4,0) tone-rules here shadow the (1,3,0)
  lane-color overrides at L37552+ — deleting them lets lane green/pink
  win over per-author tones."
- `app/style.css:34705` — `.feedback-reply::before` triple-group has
  no guard comment despite being load-bearing positioning for is-left/
  is-right dot markers. Add a short header noting "sets position:
  absolute + content for L34777 / L34781 offsets."
- `app/style.css:34729` — "FEEDBACK AUTHOR TONE LOCK" comment doesn't
  cross-reference L34660-L34667's specificity explanation. Add: "see
  L34660 banner for the (1,4,0) > (1,3,0) cascade rationale."
- `app/style.css:34735` — `--author-mid` definition lacks a "still
  consumed by L34699 (feedback-reply-count border) after PR #81 deleted
  the L34786 consumer" note. Add: "consumers: .feedback-reply-count
  (L34699)."
- `app/style.css:35077` — "Mistake Notebook layout shuffle" comment was
  written when the section header preceded shell + header + toolbar +
  styling rules; after PR #81 deleted the shell + header, the section
  now starts at the toolbar. Comment is still accurate as a generic
  layout header but consider tightening to "Mistake Notebook toolbar
  + list-card layout."
- `app/style.css:36078` — "True tail lock 2: remove the remaining
  lecture-page gutters" comment describes width/max-width/margin
  rules, but the deleted L36141-L36145 padding-left/right resets were
  the more on-point "gutter removal" rules. Comment now slightly
  mismatches what follows.
- `app/style.css:35073` — pre-existing indentation inconsistency
  inside the `@media (max-width:820px)` block (the `.mistake-list`
  rule's selector starts at column 0 while siblings are indented).
  Quick whitespace fix, not cascade-impacting.

All 7 sub-items are doc/whitespace-only, no cascade risk, no harness
impact. Bundle into a single ~25-line cosmetic-cleanup PR when
visiting this cluster next.

**Shipped 2026-06-24 in PR #82** (chore/style-comment-hardening, +24/-11
= +13 lines net). All 7 sub-items addressed. Light Explore-agent review
caught one line-number error (L37552 → L37461) which was fixed before
merge. Visual-diff unchanged (33 views — 30 at 0.000%, 3 known-noise
unrelated). Harness coverage confirms comment edits + 1 indentation
fix had zero rendering impact.

#### 3b.ii — SHIPPED PR #75 (2026-06-24): course-tracker overview + grid bundle (-21 lines)

Three orphan blocks deleted: `.course-tracker-overview { ... }`
(L14139-L14145), `.course-tracker-grid { ... }` (L14204-L14210), and
their shared `@media (max-width: 1100px)` wrapper (L14813-L14820).
All three target classes that no live DOM element carries — the
redesign replaced them with `.course-tracker-command` +
`.course-tracker-hero-card` + `.course-tracker-layout` +
`.course-tracker-side-rail`. Discovery + 3× adversarial verify
confirmed `app/index.html`, `app.js`, and runtime-CSS files all
contain zero references. The PR #53 cited `!important` shadowers
(L36989/L37147) no longer match current line numbers but it does not
matter — the rules are dead by element-absence, not cascade override.
21 lines net (one blank separator preserved per block).

**Workspace-mirror note:** `workspace/app-mirror/index.html` + `.css`
still reference the old classes. Per `docs/sync-policy.md` the mirror
is not served at runtime, so this is a non-issue today. If the mirror
ever gets synced back into `app/`, drop the orphan classes from the
mirror too.

#### 3a.i++ / 3a.ii++ — SHIPPED PR #81 (2026-06-24): cross-cluster shadowed cleanup (-41 lines)

Fresh-discovery pass against post-PR-#80 file state surfaced 7 more
cascade-shadowed blocks across the feedback, mistake-notebook, and
lesson-page surfaces:

- `app/style.css:34721-34723` `.feedback-reply.is-left::before
  { right: auto !important }` — CSS default for position:absolute
  pseudo-elements is right:auto; L34705 base group sets position
  without right; L34777 sets left:-5px. Deletion produces identical
  computed values.
- `app/style.css:34725-34730` `.feedback-reply-context` triple-group
  (background + color) — same selector + same (1,3,0) spec as the
  L34786 block (also deleted); for real DOM, L34668 [class*="tone-"]
  at (1,4,0) wins on both props anyway.
- `app/style.css:34757-34762` `.feedback-thread`
  (border-color + background) — zero-match selector because
  app.js:6276 always emits tone-N on threads; L34676 covers all real
  threads.
- `app/style.css:34786-34792` `.feedback-reply-context` triple-group
  (border + background + color) — L34668 (1,4,0) wins for every real
  reply (each has tone-N + is-left|is-right per app.js:6292).
- `app/style.css:35104-35107` `.mistake-notebook-shell`
  (width + padding-top) — L35578 (later same-spec) shorthand was
  already winning pre-deletion via shorthand-overrides-longhand.
- `app/style.css:35109-35111` `.mistake-notebook-header`
  (margin-bottom) — L35589 `margin: 0 0 clamp(...)` shorthand was
  already winning.
- `app/style.css:36141-36145` `.lesson-page-content p, li`
  (padding-left/right: 0) — byte-for-byte duplicate of L36107-L36111
  (verified via `diff`).

Verification: 5-subrange parallel discovery → 15 raw → 15 verified →
7 confirmed safe-delete after 1-skeptic adversarial review. Visual-
diff: 33 views @ 0.000% across two consecutive `--check` runs,
including strict-0.05% view 14c. 41 lines net.

#### 3b.iii — DEFERRED: MN doubled-ID specificity patterns

Discovery noted "Doubled-ID specificity patterns checked at L35492-L35493
(True EOF layout lock): those use #id#id.selector syntax and beat
single-ID at L35604; no collapse opportunity there (out of scope for
0.2% harness)." Pattern is similar to Step B's S4 (PR #49) but for
MN, not the sidebar. Needs separate harness expansion before any
action — leave as-is.

#### 3b.iv — PARTIALLY SHIPPED: state-variant override collapses (#20b)

Per Roadmap matrix Step C, the following state-variant override stacks
were NOT covered by the 28-view harness and were intentionally skipped:
- `:hover`/`:disabled`/`:focus` on `.feedback-board-card` (27×)
- `:hover`/`:disabled`/`:focus` on `.preference-profile-preview` (18×)
- `:hover`/`:disabled`/`:focus` on `.preference-preview-card` (14×)
- `:hover`/`:disabled`/`:focus` on `.preference-primary-btn` (10×)

**Phase 3.5 v4 harness expansion — SHIPPED PR #78 (2026-06-24).**
Added 5 state-variant capture views (28 → 33 views):
- `12b-preference-primary-btn-hover` — `page.hover('#preferenceSaveBtn')`
- `12c-preference-editor-focused` — `page.focus('#preferenceProfileEditor')`
- `12d-preference-secondary-btn-hover` — `page.hover('#preferenceResetBtn')`
  (closes the L13985 / L35558 grouped-selector blind spot from primary-only)
- `14d-feedback-compose-input-focused` — `page.focus('#feedbackBodyInput')`
- `14e-feedback-compose-btn-hover` — `page.hover('#feedbackSubmitBtn')`
  + child icon `i` (covers both the L35040 parent and L35050 child cascade)

Each new view uses **exact-match transform asserts** (`matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, -1)`
literal) plus `failRatio: 0.0005` (0.05% strict) — not the weak `t !== 'none'`
check. The pre-review iteration found the loose assert would silently pass
cascade-arm swaps (1-2 px translateY shifts diff at ~0.023% of the 1280×800
frame, well under the default 0.5%). Review caught 6 sev1 / 2 sev2 findings
before the PR landed; all fixed.

**§3b.iv first refactor pass — SHIPPED PR #79 (2026-06-24): −30 lines.**
Deleted 4 fully-shadowed cascade blocks:
- L13985 `.preference-primary-btn:hover, .preference-secondary-btn:hover
  { transform: translateY(-2px) }` — shadowed by L35558 (3-ID + !important,
  -1px wins). Verified by views 12b + 12d at 0.000%.
- L13998 `.preference-primary-btn:active, .preference-secondary-btn:active
  { transform + box-shadow }` — shadowed by L35563. **Cascade-only:** no
  `:active` capture view exists (see §3b.iv.followup below).
- L16757 `.feedback-input:focus, .feedback-textarea:focus, ...:focus
  { border-color + box-shadow }` — shadowed by L29380 → L37095. Verified
  by view 14d at 0.000%.
- L29380 `.feedback-input:focus, ...:focus { border-color + background +
  box-shadow !important }` — shadowed by L37095 (1-ID `#feedbackView` +
  !important). Verified by view 14d.

**§3b.iv pass 3 — SHIPPED PR #90 (2026-06-24): -22 lines.** Broad
discovery on the 3 selectors yielded **0 candidates** on `.feedback-board-card`
(27×) and `.preference-profile-preview` (18×), and **1 candidate** on
`.preference-preview-card` (14×). The /code-review of that 1 candidate
surfaced 2 more adjacent candidates not in the original selector list.
Final bundle:

- L13841-L13850 grouped `.preference-{profile,ai,preview}-card { position;
  background; border; border-radius; padding; box-shadow }` — all 6 props
  on all 3 arms shadowed by L35214-L35229 `#preferenceView` !important +
  L35254 / L35261-L35264 padding clamp(). Sister classes only inside
  `#preferenceView` per index.html L1023/1040/1060.
- L13834-L13839 `.preference-page-grid { display; grid-template-columns;
  gap; align-items }` — all 4 props shadowed by L35195 `#preferenceView
  .preference-page-grid` (1,1,0 !important) + L36016 `@media (max-width:
  1180px) #preferenceView ...` for the narrow-viewport path. Only DOM
  use is inside #preferenceView per index.html:1022.
- L13841-L13843 `.preference-profile-card { min-height: 640px }` —
  shadowed by L35185 grouped `#preferenceView .preference-{...}-card
  { min-height: 0 !important }`.

3-skeptic adversarial verify confirmed safe-delete: no @media/@container
wrap-escape, dark-mode rule L14813 cannot escape !important shadow, no
state-variant fallback. Visual-diff harness: 35/35 @ 0.000% across two
consecutive `--check` runs after each commit (view 12 preference-page
resting state is the load-bearing pixel guard).

**Plan-target correction (matches §3a.i + Step B/C/D pattern):** the
"~120-170 lines" estimate was off by an order of magnitude against the
3 named selectors. Post-discovery ceiling on `.feedback-board-card` /
`.preference-profile-preview` / `.preference-preview-card` is ~10 lines;
the additional 11 lines came from adjacent rules (`.preference-page-grid`
+ surviving `.preference-profile-card` min-height) surfaced by review,
not by the named-selector discovery. The 120-170-line estimate from
Roadmap Step C predates the §3b.iv pass 1+2 deletions (PR #79 -30, PR
#84 -42 = -72 lines) which already harvested the bulk of the easy wins
from this surface. Future state-variant work on these selectors needs
NEW harness views (no `:hover`/`:focus`/`:active` on `.feedback-board-card`
in the 35-view set) before further deletion is safe.

#### 3b.iv.followup — Cascade-shadow remnants near PR #90 (CLOSED PR #91)

The `/code-review` follow-up from PR #90 + a parallel broader discovery
agent surfaced 3 candidates, all bundled and shipped in PR #91:

- L14818 @media (max-width:1100px) .preference-page-grid (now removed).
- L13923 preference editor :focus / ai-input :focus (now removed) —
  shadower's `transform: none !important` was already winning pre-delete;
  view 12c at 0.000% diff confirms.
- L29356 feedback-{primary,secondary,reply}-btn:hover (now removed) —
  shadower's identical-property !important block at L36965 was already
  winning by spec; view 14e covers the .feedback-primary-btn arm.

Adversarial verify of PR #91 returned a false-positive on candidate 1
(reviewer asserted "focus lift lost" without verifying the cascade
direction — the shadower already cancelled the lift pre-delete). Pixel
evidence (view 12c) refuted the verdict. Lesson: when /code-review
flags a state-variant deletion, always confirm with the relevant pixel
view's diff value rather than treating the verdict as authoritative.

#### 3b.iv.followup — Harness gaps surfaced by PR #79 self-review

Three sev3 latent blind spots in the v4 harness (none block any landed
work; they apply to FUTURE refactors of the same cluster):

- **No `:active` view** for any button. PR #79's deletion of L13998
  (`.preference-primary-btn:active` block) was cascade-shadow-only.
  A future delete or reorder of L35563 (the current winner) would
  silently regress mousedown chrome on `#preferenceSaveBtn` and
  siblings. Add a `12e-preference-primary-btn-active` view that holds
  `page.mouse.down()` over the button bounding box (or addStyleTag
  forces `.preference-primary-btn:active`) and asserts
  `matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1)` from L35563.
- **View 14d only covers `.feedback-textarea:focus`** (the textarea
  arm). The L37095 grouped selector also covers `.feedback-input`,
  `.feedback-reply-name`, `.feedback-reply-input`. Add a
  `14f-feedback-input-focused` view focusing `#feedbackNameInput`
  (or `#feedbackTitleInput`) to validate the `.feedback-input` arm;
  the reply-input arms only appear when a thread is rendered AND
  the user clicks "Reply", so a `14g-feedback-reply-input-focused`
  view would need 14b's seeded fixture + a click-to-open-reply step.
- **L37095 sets `outline: none !important`** — not present in any
  view's assertion. A future delete of L37095 leaves the textarea
  with the default browser focus ring, a ~2-3 px outline that would
  diff visibly but is hard to assert precisely. View 14d's pixel
  diff IS the guard; document the dependency.

### 3c. PR #20c Pass 2 — Home Ask + answer workspace + login + intro

**Status (2026-06-22, end of session): partially complete.** Step D
shipped 3 PRs (#56/#57/#58) totalling **−147 lines** in `app/style.css`,
all visual-diff-verified at 0.000% on all 18 baseline views. Plan target
was ~3,500 lines; 4.2% of plan was reachable, well below even the
Step B/C 14% structural ceiling because S3 (login + intro) and S4
(RUNTIME-INJECTED banners) were both verified at **0 deletable lines**.

#### What shipped in Step D

- **PR #56 — S1 RIGHT-QA REDESIGN dead overrides** — 14 home-Ask rules
  inside `TRUE EOF HOME ASK RIGHT-QA REDESIGN` banner fully shadowed
  by later `SCREENSHOT MATCH` (L41542+) + `GLOBAL SHRINK` (L41833+)
  banners at identical specificity, !important. Per-property timeline
  built for each rule (`.home-ask-icon`, `.home-ask-empty h1/p`,
  `.home-ask-tag`, `.home-ask-tag svg`, `.home-ask-attach/.send`,
  `.home-mode-icon`, `web-toggle svg`, `#homeModeMenu .home-mode-option`,
  `.home-feature-actions`, `.home-feature-chip` + svg + span,
  `:has(.home-mode-menu.show)`). 115 lines.
- **PR #57 — S1b SCREENSHOT MATCH tail** — 5 more home-Ask rules in
  the `SCREENSHOT MATCH` banner shadowed by `GLOBAL SHRINK` (L41754+
  post-#56). Includes `.home-ask-tag svg`, `.home-ask-input-row` (with
  align-items: start fallback to L41225's RIGHT-QA REDESIGN survivor),
  `#homeModeCurrentText`, `web-toggle` standalone, `#homeModeMenu`
  positional. 28 lines.
- **PR #58 — S2 followup-bar-row gap** — bare `.followup-bar-row
  { gap: 16px !important }` (specificity 0,0,1,0) shadowed by
  `.answer .followup-bar-row { gap: 8px !important }` (0,0,2,0) at
  L43811. DOM coverage verified: `.followup-bar-row` only renders
  inside `.answer` per `app/index.html` L518/L572. The discovery +
  2-skeptic adversarial verify workflow found ONLY this candidate
  across the full Section 2 surface (~1,400 lines pre-scan). 4 lines.

**Cumulative Step D delta: −147 lines (44408 → 44261).**

#### Why the 3,500-line plan target proved unreachable

Same structural-ceiling pattern as Step B/C, plus two surfaces with
verified zero recoverable lines:

- Pass 1 (#42) had already shipped −20 in this range — easy wins
  taken. The L33490 / L42594 RUNTIME-INJECTED banners were deferred
  to S4 (see §3d below) — removing them from the available pool.
- After PR #56 + #57 took ~143 lines from the home-Ask cascade,
  remaining home-Ask candidates from the discovery workflow are
  state-variant-only (`:focus-within` transform/animation deletes)
  which the 18-view harness cannot pixel-verify. Deferred to §3c.i
  below.
- **Section 3 (login + intro/trial scrapbook) = 0 lines deletable.**
  The plan's "inverted preference" claim that `app/css/inline-styles.css`
  is a canonical source for `.intro-*`, `.scrap-*`, `.proof-*`, and
  `.login-*` rules is wrong against the current file state. Verified:
  inline-styles.css has ZERO `.login-*` rules at all. The
  `.intro-landing-new .scrap-*` rules in inline-styles.css define
  base structure (position, dimensions, base background-color #fff,
  animations); the style.css L44048+ "Trial intro glass skin" banner
  OVERLAYS them with glass effects (background gradients,
  backdrop-filter, box-shadow). Both layers are live; neither is
  dead. See §3c.ii below.
- **Section 4 (RUNTIME-INJECTED CSS OVERRIDE banners L33490 + L42594)
  = 0 lines deletable.** Verified load-bearing — see §3d below.

Realistic Step D ceiling post-analysis: ~165 lines if the remaining
state-variant candidates were ship-able. The ~3,350-line gap to the
original 3,500 target is structural (S3 + S4 both verified zero,
state-variant blind spot blocks remaining home-Ask).

#### 3c.i — PARTIALLY SHIPPED: remaining home-Ask state-variant candidates

The discovery workflow for S1 surfaced ~145 additional safe-on-cascade
lines, partly shipped:

- **§3c.i pass 1 — SHIPPED PR #94 (2026-06-24): −39 lines.** DEBUG
  LOCK banner cluster (L38374-L38465 pre-PR-#94): `.home-mode-option`
  4-prop block (shadowed by L39244-L39248 + later same-spec
  redeclarations through L40935), `:focus-within` transform +
  animation `home-ask-focus-real-bounce` (shadowed by L39180-L39184
  using `home-ask-in-place-pop`), dead `@keyframes
  home-ask-focus-real-bounce` (only ref was inside the deleted
  `:focus-within` block), and the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion:
  reduce) :focus-within` duplicate (identical to L39263-L39269).
  Discovery dispatched as parallel Explore agent + 2-skeptic
  adversarial verify (skeptic A returned false-positive citing
  "banner-tier" narrative; pixel diff at view 10 + view 11 was the
  tiebreaker, both 0.000%). 35/35 views @ 0.000% across two
  consecutive `--check` runs.
- **DEFERRED: `:focus-within` transform/animation deletes** in
  cluster-B/C/D banners (~52 lines pre-PR-#94 estimate; line numbers
  now shift after #94). Each is byte-identical to a later same-
  selector same-specificity rule, so deletion does not change the
  active value, but the additional clusters touch composer state
  not covered by view 10 (e.g., dropdown sub-states). **Defer rule
  D2.** Re-run discovery agent after re-baselining line numbers.
- **DEFERRED: Cluster-A initial `.home-mode-icon i`, `.qa-caret-icon`,
  web-toggle svg, `.home-mode-option.selected`** (~18 lines, pre-#56
  L38762-L38818). Earlier control glass banner. Safe on cascade,
  state-variant-free, but small enough that ROI on the PR ceremony
  is poor. Could bundle with the next §3c.i discovery pass.
- **DEFERRED: INTERACTION LOCK tail remainders.** Per the Explore
  agent's BANNER 2 finding (TRUE EOF HOME ASK INTERACTION LOCK,
  L39162-L39270 in current file), all rules contain at least one
  load-bearing property — no whole-rule SAFE-DELETE candidates.
  Property-level deletion (PARTIAL classification) would require
  per-rule edits that change cascade winners; needs case-by-case
  analysis. **Defer rule D3** — structural ceiling: the cleanly-
  deletable subset is captured by pass 1.
- **§3c.i pass 5 — SHIPPED PR #98 (2026-06-24): −38 lines.** SIZE
  RESTORE banner (L39544+ pre-PR-#98) 6 whole-rule blocks shadowed
  by LEARN-QA MATCH (L39716+) at identical selector + specificity +
  `!important`: `.home-ask-empty p` (5 props), `.home-ask-tag svg`
  (2 props), `.home-ask-input-row` (2 props), `#userInput.search-input`
  (4 props), `.home-ask-toolbar` (2 props), `.home-feature-chip`
  (5 props). LEARN-QA MATCH covers all 20 props at L39750/L39785/L39828/
  L39845/L39859/L39904 — later banners (GLOBAL SHRINK, SCREENSHOT MATCH)
  also re-cover most props, but LEARN-QA is the first shadow so SIZE
  RESTORE's values never reach the cascade. Discovery via single Explore
  agent (VERY THOROUGH breadth) + manual per-property verification +
  7-angle `/code-review` medium-effort (all 3 correctness angles
  returned `[]`). 35/35 views @ 0.000% across two consecutive `--check`
  runs (incl. views 10 home-ask-focused + 11 home-mode-menu-open as
  pixel guards). **Structural ceiling for SIZE RESTORE reached at the
  6-rule slice** — remaining SIZE RESTORE rules each have at least one
  property not shadowed by any later banner.
- **VERIFIED ZERO: GLOBAL SHRINK + MODE GLASS.** Pass 5 discovery
  confirmed both banners have **zero** whole-rule SAFE-DELETE
  candidates. GLOBAL SHRINK (L40550+) is the cascade winner for almost
  all its props (MODE GLASS only re-declares glass/background props,
  not the dimensional/typographic props GLOBAL SHRINK owns). MODE GLASS
  (L40702+) is the source-order winner for the home-ask family — no
  later same-selector `!important` rules exist for its frosted-glass
  selectors. **Defer rule D3** — structural ceiling for both banners.
- **§3c.i pass 6 — SHIPPED PR #99 (2026-06-24): −63 lines.** Earliest
  HOME ASK banners (predating all "EOF" series) cleared:
  - SPACING TIGHTEN (L28993+): 11 bare/prefixed rules — `.home-ask-stage`,
    `.home-ask-icon`, `.home-ask-empty h1`, `.home-ask-empty p`,
    `.home-ask-tags`, `.home-ask-tag`, `.welcome.home-ask-workspace
    .home-ask-composer` (already prefixed), `.welcome.home-ask-workspace
    .home-ask-input-row` (already prefixed), `.home-ask-toolbar`,
    `.home-feature-actions`, `.home-feature-chip svg`. Each shadowed by
    LEARN-QA MATCH (L39679+) or GLOBAL SHRINK (L40512+) at higher spec
    `(0,2,1)+` `!important`. R11 `.home-feature-chip` and R13
    `.home-feature-chip span` KEPT — both declare `letter-spacing: 0`
    which is NOT re-declared by any later `.welcome.home-ask-workspace`-
    scoped rule (verified: L39866 / L40428 / L40642 / L40449 all lack
    `letter-spacing`). Banner header rewritten to reflect what survives.
  - MODE BUTTON PARITY (L29058+): bare `.home-ask-toolbar { gap: 10px }`
    shadowed 6× by later prefixed rules.
  - MODULE POSITION (L29120-L29125): entire banner deleted. Single rule
    `.home-ask-stage > .home-ask-empty, .home-ask-composer,
    .home-feature-actions { transform: translateY(28px) }` has
    IDENTICAL-selector / IDENTICAL-spec shadower at FINAL POSITION L29866
    with `transform: translateY(56px) !important` — source-order tiebreak.
  - **DOM-scope justification:** verified via `app/index.html:405-509`
    that every `.home-ask-*` class only renders inside
    `<div class="welcome home-ask-workspace">`. Therefore bare-selector
    rules at (0,1,0) are subsumed by later prefixed (0,2,1)+ `!important`
    rules wherever they target the same property.
  - 7-angle `/code-review` medium-effort returned `[]` on all 3 correctness
    angles. 35/35 views @ 0.000% across two consecutive `--check` runs.

**§3c.i pass 7 ceiling reached.** PR #100 deleted 3 of the 6 MODE
BUTTON PARITY prefixed rules; the surviving 3 (.home-mode-toggle,
.home-mode-icon, .home-mode-icon i) each have ≥1 unshadowed property
(display, align-items, justify-content, line-height) per the §3c.i
pass 7 discovery agent. The unshadowed props are foundational flex
+ typographic baseline values not re-declared by any later HOME ASK
banner — they're load-bearing.

**§3c.i pass 8 — STRUCTURAL CEILING (defer rule D3): zero candidates
in LIQUID GLASS TEST (L29930-L30048, post-#100).** Discovery walked
the banner against all later HOME ASK banners (CONTROL GLASS LOCK
L37825 → MODE GLASS L40581). Findings:

- 2 rules (L29961 grouped background+border+box-shadow on input-row /
  composer / #userInput, L29970 .home-ask-input-row border-radius) are
  NOT-SHADOWED. No later rule re-declares these aesthetic props.
- 1 rule (L30028 `.home-ask-send` border + background + box-shadow +
  backdrop-filter) is NOT-SHADOWED. Later `.home-ask-send` rules only
  declare sizing/border-radius.
- 1 rule (L30011 grouped 4-arm glass on .home-ask-tag/.home-mode-toggle/
  .home-ask-web-toggle/.home-feature-chip) is PARTIAL — 2 arms fully
  shadowed (mode-toggle + web-toggle by L37846), 2 arms PARTIAL
  (.home-ask-tag + .home-feature-chip — backdrop-filter unshadowed).
  Splitting a 4-arm grouped selector to delete 2 arms is risky for the
  cascade-walk pattern this loop uses; deferred.
- 1 rule (L29954 grouped position+z-index on input-row/toolbar/attach-
  preview) is PARTIAL — only `.home-ask-toolbar` arm shadowed.
- ::before / ::after / :focus-within / :disabled / @keyframes / @media
  rules all skipped (harness D2 blindspot for state-variant + pseudo-
  element coverage).

**Pattern note:** the earlier HOME ASK banners declared AESTHETIC
properties (glass, shadows, blur, backdrop-filter, ::before /::after
positioning); later "EOF" banners declare DIMENSIONAL + TYPOGRAPHIC
properties (height, padding, gap, font-size). The two property sets
are largely disjoint, so the aesthetic rules in LIQUID GLASS TEST
remain the only source of their values and cannot be deleted without
adversely affecting the rendered glass effect.

**Entry point for future §3c.i pass 9 (LOW PRIORITY):** L30011
grouped selector split into 4 separate rules — delete the 2 arms
`.home-mode-toggle, #webSearchToggleBtnMain.home-ask-web-toggle`
(shadowed by L37846) and keep the 2 arms `.home-ask-tag,
.home-feature-chip` (backdrop-filter unshadowed). Would save ~12 lines
if executed cleanly. Requires careful grouped-selector splitting —
defer until a future pass that bundles multiple similar splits.

**Entry point for §3c.i pass 3:** PR #95 (pass 2) covered the
preceding HOME ASK CONTROL MOTION TUNE banner (L38064-L38128
pre-#95). Remaining unanalyzed HOME ASK banners (current
post-#95 line numbers, file at 43,195):
- TRUE EOF HOME ASK POLISH LOCK L39175+
- TRUE EOF HOME ASK UPWARD MENU FIX L39433+
- TRUE EOF HOME ASK SIZE RESTORE L39556+
- TRUE EOF HOME ASK LEARN-QA MATCH L39728+
- TRUE EOF HOME ASK SCALE CORRECTION L39962+
- TRUE EOF HOME ASK RIGHT-QA REDESIGN L40083+
- TRUE EOF HOME ASK SCREENSHOT MATCH L40370+
- TRUE EOF HOME ASK GLOBAL SHRINK L40633+
- TRUE EOF HOME ASK MODE GLASS L40785+

Re-dispatch the same Explore agent prompt against these banners
(or against earlier HOME ASK CONTROL GLASS LOCK L37888+ since
pass 2 confirmed it has no whole-rule SAFE-DELETE candidates per
the prior agent finding — likely correct, but re-verify).
Same 2-skeptic + pixel-tiebreaker workflow.

PARTIAL holdouts from pass 2 (KEPT in MOTION TUNE banner):
- L38118-L38124 (now ~L38065+) `.home-mode-menu` base — interacts
  with prefers-reduced-motion @media at L38130 (which targets
  3 selectors including this base). Splitting the @media block
  to drop the menu arm + then deleting the base could land ~10
  lines; defer until a future pass that touches the reduced-
  motion block holistically.

**Entry point:** rebase the existing discovery output
(`/tmp/claude-1000/-mnt-d-Github-fourier-tutor-agent/.../wzd6pqscb.output`)
against post-#58 line numbers (each candidate shifts down by 4 lines
in the L42278+ region only; everything below L41434 is shifted by 115
from #56 and 28 from #57; everything below L42278 is also shifted by
4 from #58). Re-verify each candidate's cited override line in the
post-merge file before edit.

#### 3c.ii — Plan-inventory correction: inverted-preference S3 is wrong

Plan §6.1 says: "Inverted preference for the intro/login surface
(banners 81-88): the `.intro-*`, `.scrap-*`, `.proof-*` rules in
`app/css/inline-styles.css` are the canonical source; the style.css
copies are duplicates."

**This is wrong against the current file state.** Verified during
Step D Section 3:

1. `app/css/inline-styles.css` has ZERO `.login-*` selectors. The
   plan's premise that login rules duplicate inline-styles.css does
   not match reality.
2. The `.intro-landing-new .scrap-window/sticky/polaroid/paper/
   proof-card` rules ARE in inline-styles.css (L443-L666 area), but
   they set BASE structure: `position: absolute; background: #fff;
   transform: rotate(Xdeg); animation: float ...`.
3. The corresponding rules in style.css L44049+ ("Trial intro glass
   skin") set DIFFERENT properties: glass gradients, backdrop-filter,
   box-shadow. They are layered OVERLAYS, not duplicates.

Conclusion: no Section 3 deletes are possible under the inverted-
preference rule. Future Phase 4 work on this surface should be
scoped as "consolidate the L44048+ glass skin into inline-styles.css"
(a STRUCTURAL refactor, not a delete), and that's only worth doing
if the visual-diff harness gains login + intro coverage first.

### 3d. PR #20c — RUNTIME-INJECTED CSS OVERRIDE banner deletion

**Status (2026-06-22, end of session): VERIFIED LOAD-BEARING — stays.**

Per plan §3d entry point, listed every property each banner sets and
grep'd `runtime-collapsed.css` for overlap on the same elements:

- **L33490 banner (`LEARN Q&A RUNTIME INJECTION OVERRIDE`)** — uses
  doubled-ID specificity (`#learnView#learnView #learnBody#learnBody
  #learnChatCol#learnChatCol` = 6 IDs). `runtime-collapsed.css`
  L1430-L1451 sets `background: var(--theme-page-surface-soft)
  !important` on `#learnView #learnChatCol` (2 IDs). Style.css's
  6-ID rule beats with a custom radial-gradient cyan/green
  background. Deleting the banner reverts to the runtime-collapsed
  background-color — visible regression.
- **L42594 banner (`RUNTIME-INJECTED CSS OVERRIDE`)** — uses tripled-
  ID specificity (`#learnView#learnView#learnView ... #learnFollowupBar
  #learnFollowupBar #learnFollowupBar` = 12 IDs). `runtime-collapsed.css`
  L1975-L2002 has a doubled-ID rule (8 IDs) on the same selector with
  DIFFERENT values: width `min(820px, calc(100% - 36px))` vs banner's
  `calc(100% - 36px)`, min-height 112 vs 152, border-radius 18 vs 28,
  different background gradient. Deleting the banner regresses 8+
  properties on the followup-bar.

Plan decision #5 ("delete in #20c") was based on the assumption that
the runtime-injected `<style>` blocks were the SOLE source of the
duplicated-ID rules. PR #22 actually MOVED those doubled-ID rules into
runtime-collapsed.css (not just the targeted overrides). So the
defended-against rules came along with the moved blocks, and the
banners still need higher specificity to beat them.

**No follow-up entry — both banners stay.**

## 4. Plan-inventory corrections to fold into the next Pass 2 PR — DONE 2026-06-24

The plan §6.2 Pass 1 list contained inaccurate "orphan" flags:

- **`.preference-signal-card` and `.preference-signal-label`** (claimed
  orphan for #20b) — actually **LIVE**, used in
  `app/preference-profile.js` as static `class="..."` strings (verified
  L175-176).
- **`.mistake-note-image-empty` and `.mistake-note-image-chip`**
  (claimed orphan for #20c) — actually **LIVE**, used in
  `app/mistake-notebook.js` (verified L247 + L252).

Both pairs were verified during the Pass 1 work and skipped. `docs/phase3_plan.md`
§6.2 updated 2026-06-24 with strikethrough + DO-NOT-DELETE callouts so
a future contributor running the §6.2 orphan-sweep doesn't re-flag them.

## 5. Phase-4 candidates unblocked by Phase 3

- **Phase 2 #18 — Interactive demos subsystem extraction.** Per
  `docs/phase3_plan.md` §7: was 4,018 lines; after #21 lands the
  family modules, the remaining scope is ~1,500 lines (demo
  registration, state stores, control wiring).
- **Phase 2 #19 — Glass + chapter-overview CSS** (16,402 lines).
  Schedule once the visual-diff harness has expanded view coverage
  beyond the current 9 baseline views.
- **Phase 4 user-data DB migration** for `app/users/` (rule #3 of
  the refactor plan).

`app/style.css`: **44,845 → 42,991 lines (−1,854, −4.13%)**.

**Adversarial-review pattern (PR #91 + PR #93):** /code-review repeatedly
returns inverted-cascade false-positives on state-variant and value-divergent
deletions. The reviewer asserts a regression based on the BASE rule's value
without checking which side actually wins the cascade pre-delete. In every
case the !important shadower was already winning, so the post-delete render
is bit-identical to the pre-delete render — pixel-evidence (view 12c / view
13 at 0.000%) is the definitive refutation. Lesson for future PRs: when
the reviewer flags a value-divergence regression on a shadowed-base delete,
ALWAYS verify by re-reading the shadower's specificity + !important parity
and the relevant pixel-view's diff value, not just the verdict text.

The Phase 3 JS work is structurally complete. CSS Pass 1 + Pass 2
Steps A through D shipped; the structural ceiling on the L33181–L44261
cluster is ~12% of the original ~5,600-line target (Pass 1 + Pass 2 =
584 lines actual). The remaining ~5,000 lines on this cluster are
specificity-graded defenses, state-variant override stacks not covered
by the harness, banner-rewrite candidates requiring coordinated multi-
banner refactors, or canonical-source-clash candidates where the
plan's inverted-preference assumption did not match the file state.

## 7. Phase 3.5 follow-ups (PR #44 review-deferred)

Drafted 2026-06-22 after the PR #44 5-lens review. PR #44 (Phase 3.5
visual-diff harness expansion, 9 → 18 views) shipped at f28055b after
must-fixes 1–12 and should-fixes A–G,I–M were folded in. The items
below were intentionally left out of PR #44 as out-of-scope follow-ups.

### 7a. Harness architecture (defer for v2)

- **Parallel pipelines per Page A/B/C via `Promise.all`.** Spec v2
  permitted sequential v1 as acceptable. The bridge serializes
  internally and the wall-clock saving (~30–50s) is not worth the
  flake risk without a separate spec for bridge concurrency.
- **`global.__pageCResults` → closure-threaded `runCtx`.** Acceptable
  smell for serial execution; refactor when concurrency lands.
- **PAGE_C scaling beyond 2 family-key coverage** — if a future PR
  adds views 19+ for additional dispatcher keys, refactor PAGE_C to a
  handler that opens lessons sequentially with closeSection between
  captures rather than one page per family (spec deferred §10).
- **Page B `requires` field for declarative preconditions.** Spec table
  pattern lists per-view preconditions; today implemented as imperative
  recovery in each setup(). Works, but a `requires` table would make
  the preconditions auditable in one place.

### 7b. settleLesson / masking polish

- **settleLesson font warmup loads generics only, not real webfonts.**
  Calls `document.fonts.load('1em sans-serif')` etc.; real fix is
  enumerating `document.fonts` and forcing each face. Current
  implementation is good enough — no observed pixel drift.
- **settleLesson re-runs font warmup on every screenshot.** Sentinel-
  gating possible (skip if a "fonts warmed up" flag is set on the
  page) but adds complexity for a one-time cost.
- **Feedback meta locale-stable timestamp width** (latent CI flake).
  Today masked via `color:transparent !important; text-shadow:none`;
  if a future regression involves text-shape regression it might leak.
  Real fix: tabular-nums + min-width on the meta line.
- **MASK_CSS UID length variable** — the masked `.settings-user-meta`
  line still occupies space proportional to the random UID's length.
  Today no observed drift, but a seeded random or fixed-width clamp
  would harden it.
- **settleLesson + resetLessonChromeState arbitrary 150ms / 100ms
  tails.** Replace with `waitForFunction` on `.is-animating` absence;
  mild — current sleeps work.

### 7c. Self-test + cross-reference

- **Add startup self-test for `window.*` harness exports to
  `npm run check`.** A `node tools/check-harness-exports.js` that
  greps `app/app.js` for the harness-relied-on window exports
  (`window.parseBase64JsonAttr`, `window.inferInteractiveDemoFamily`)
  would surface a deleted export at lint time instead of at first
  --check run. Good idea; requires new script + package.json wire-up.
- **Cross-reference comment on `window.__ftutorRefreshPager`.**
  Consistency only — already exposed in app/app.js without a "harness
  export" comment band like the other window.* exports.
- **View 11 `.show` re-apply across 2 rAFs.** Defensive against a stray
  document.click race auto-closing the menu mid-screenshot. Today not
  observed flaking. Add a 2-rAF re-apply if intermittent failure ever
  surfaces.

### 7d. Test fixture organization

- **SUBTOPIC fixture centralization between smoke.js + visual-diff.js.**
  Both files hard-code `1_1-1 Signal Energy` as the canonical test
  subtopic. Minor duplication; move to `tools/test-utils.js` as
  `CANONICAL_SUBTOPIC` if a third caller appears.
- **3.12 / 3.13 Page C candidates blocked by openSubtopic shape.**
  Spec v2's view 18 fallback list included `3.12` / `3.13` (cache
  present in `workspace/materials/lesson-cache/`), but those sections
  live as standalone entries in `syllabus-data.js` without
  `subsections:` — openSubtopic's 3-tuple `(chapter, section, title)`
  shape cannot navigate to them. The implementation drops them from
  the candidate list with an inline comment. To re-enable, teach
  openSubtopic to fall through `card.click()` when no subsection card
  is present and click the section row directly.

### 7e. PR description hygiene

- **Update PR #44 description** noting Commit 1 was not strictly
  pixel-neutral — the MASK_CSS additions in Commit 2 followed because
  the BrowserContext-level injection in Commit 1 exposed mask gaps
  that the old per-page injection had hidden. Spec § "Rebaseline
  rollout" promised strict pixel-neutrality on Commit 1; the actual
  experience was 6 baselines moved on Commit 1. Document this once
  the PR merges.

## 8. Phase 3.5 v2 follow-ups (Glass coverage expansion)

Drafted 2026-06-22 after Phase 3.5 v2 self-review. PR (TBD on merge)
extended the harness from 18 → 25 views, closing the Glass-surface gap
that gated Step G.3 (Phase 2 #19, app/style.css L31257–L47658).

### What shipped in Phase 3.5 v2

7 new views, all 0.000% pixel-diff across two consecutive `--check`
runs:

- **View 19** — `19-login-screen` (Page D, new bootstrap via
  `enterLoginView`). Covers FINAL LOGIN LIQUID GLASS L43321+.
- **View 20** — `20-sidebar-collapsed` (Page A late). Covers FINAL
  COLLAPSED SIDEBAR GLASS FIX L43241+ via direct `.app.sidebar-collapsed`
  + `#leftSidebar.collapsed` class flips.
- **View 21** — `21-lesson-key-takeaways` (Page A, paginates to summary
  KP via the shared `advanceLessonUntil` helper). Covers ABSOLUTE EOF
  KEY TAKEAWAYS GLASS LOCK L39295+.
- **View 22** — `22-lesson-quick-check` (Page A, continues pagination
  to quiz KP). Covers ABSOLUTE EOF QUICK CHECK GLASS LOCK L39494+.
- **View 23** — `23-textbook-focus` (Page A overlay). Covers TEXTBOOK
  FOCUS GLASS LOCK L42981+ via forced modal show + mock-image stub.
- **View 24** — `24-answer-workspace` (Page B late). Covers ANSWER
  WORKSPACE LIQUID GLASS L41934+ via showAnswer subset replay
  (including topbar.classList.remove('hidden') to match production).
- **View 25** — `25-quick-setup-modal` (Page B overlay). Covers TRUE
  EOF QUICK SETUP GLASS MODAL L40258+ via inline `display:flex` on
  `#quizOverlay` — chrome only; option-card descendants deferred.

Also extended `tools/test-utils.js`: new `enterLoginView()` helper for
Page D bootstrap, new MASK_CSS rules for the login WebGL canvas + login
decorative motion + textbook-focus raster pages.

Also extended `tools/visual-diff.js`: new module-scope
`advanceLessonUntil(page, sentinelSelector)` pagination helper used by
views 21/22 to walk the lesson pager until a target Glass card lands.

### 8a — DEFERRED: Quick Setup modal #quizSteps content

View 25 force-shows `#quizOverlay` via inline `style.display='flex'`
but leaves `#quizSteps` empty. The Glass chrome (card, backdrop, title)
is pixel-locked; the per-step option-card and progress-indicator
descendants rendered by `renderQuizStep` (app.js L271+) are NOT. A
future PR touching the quiz modal styling could regress these inner
selectors without --check noticing.

**Entry point:** stub minimal option-card HTML into `#quizSteps` before
the screenshot — match the structure `renderQuizStep` emits but with
deterministic placeholder text. Risk: stub drift if `renderQuizStep`
restructures its output. Mitigation: expose `window.__ftutorRenderQuizStep
= renderQuizStep` (matches the existing `window.parseBase64JsonAttr` /
`window.inferInteractiveDemoFamily` pattern) and call it directly with
a fixture step.

### 8b — DEFERRED: window.* exposure pattern for force-flip views

Views 20 (sidebar-collapsed), 23 (textbook-focus), 24 (answer-workspace)
all bypass real production trigger functions (`setWorkspaceSidebarCollapsed`
at app.js L7443, `openTextbookFocusMode` at L3293, `showAnswer` at L6080)
and instead reproduce a subset of each function's DOM mutations inline.
This works but creates a divergence channel: when production adds a
new sibling-panel hide or aria attribute, the harness silently drifts.

**Entry point:** in `app/app.js`, expose the three trigger functions on
window using the same band-comment pattern as
`window.parseBase64JsonAttr` (L1084) and `window.inferInteractiveDemoFamily`
(near the dispatcher). Then rewrite views 20/23/24's `setup()` to call
`window.__ftutor*` directly. Eliminates ~25 lines of replicated logic
across the three views.

### 8c — DEFERRED: textbook-focus real-section coverage

View 23 injects a mock textbook page (1×1 PNG) into `#textbookFocusContent`
because §1.1-1 has no `#learnBookOverlay` images registered, so
`openTextbookFocusMode` (which reads `_bookOverlay.querySelectorAll('.textbook-page-card img')`)
cannot run. The current force-show + mock-HTML stub captures the Glass
modal chrome but bypasses any future CSS that depends on real
textbook-state attributes (e.g. `[data-page-mode]`, `:has(.is-zoomed)`).

**Entry point:** identify a cached section in `workspace/materials/` that
has `new-book-figures/` data registered and use it for view 23 instead
of stubbing. Tradeoff: loads more lesson chrome into the captured area
+ ties view 23 to a different SUBTOPIC than §1.1-1, complicating
sequencing on Page A.

### 8d — DEFERRED: enterLoginView + enterGuestMode intro-dismiss dedup

Both helpers do `page.goto(base)` + `page.click('#introGetStartedBtn')`
in their first two lines, then diverge. If `#introGetStartedBtn` is
renamed or the intro flow gains a confirmation step, both helpers must
be updated in lockstep. Drift surfaces only when `--check` fails.

**Entry point:** extract `dismissIntro(page, base)` to `tools/test-utils.js`
and have both `enterGuestMode` and `enterLoginView` call it before their
divergent next-step. ~6 lines saved + closes the drift channel.

### 8e — DEFERRED: MASK_CSS per-view organization

`MASK_CSS` is now a 50-line shared block covering 6 distinct UI surfaces
(introWebglContainer, recent timestamps, feedback meta, input caret,
home-mode menu, settings UID, login WebGL, login motion, textbook
raster). Future contributors adding view 26+ have no convention for
"add mask here or scope locally?".

**Entry point:** split `MASK_CSS` into `GLOBAL_MASK_CSS` (timestamps,
captions, `.is-animating`) and `PER_VIEW_MASKS = { '19-login-screen':
'...', '23-textbook-focus': '...' }`. `captureView` injects the
per-view block before screenshot via `page.addStyleTag` and removes it
after.  Defers a noisy file diff for marginal organization gain — skip
unless Phase 4 adds 5+ more views.

### 8f — DEFERRED: advanceLessonUntil sharing with collectLessonFamilies

`advanceLessonUntil` (visual-diff.js module scope) walks the lesson
pager until a sentinel selector lands. `collectLessonFamilies`
(visual-diff.js L423-L524) walks the lesson pager accumulating families
across all KPs. Both use the same `data-lesson-page` change-watcher
pattern. Two divergent copies of the pager-walking contract.

**Entry point:** generalize either into a single walker with a
configurable `stopWhen` predicate. Defer until a third caller appears
(test-utils.js `paginateLesson(page, opts)` with `mode: 'until' |
'collect'`). Saves ~25 lines + single-point-of-truth for pager timing.

## 9. Phase 3.5 v3 follow-ups (G.3.2 + G.3.3 coverage gaps)

Identified during PR #64 (Step G.3.2) and PR #65 (Step G.3.3) adversarial
reviews on 2026-06-22. Two of three gaps closed on 2026-06-23 via PRs #69
+ #70; one (§9c gap 2 narrow-viewport) remains deferred.

### 9a — SHIPPED (PR #69, 2026-06-23): populated feedback-board view

View 14 (`14-feedback-board`) captures the EMPTY feedback board state:
`app/users/feedback-board.json` does not exist, `readFeedbackBoard()`
returns `{items:[]}`, and `renderFeedbackBoard` (app.js:6249) emits
`<div class="feedback-empty">No suggestions yet.</div>`. NO
`.feedback-thread`, `.feedback-reply`, `.tone-N`, `.is-left`, `.is-right`,
`.feedback-replies`, or `.feedback-click-reply` node ever materializes.

**Consequence:** Step G.3.2 (PR #64) shipped 121 lines of `#feedbackView`
deletions with ZERO pixel coverage on the deleted selectors. The
0/25-views-at-0.000% result is mechanically correct but vacuous for
those rules. Cascade-shadow analysis (every deleted rule verified to
have a same-or-higher specificity later shadower in the same file) is
the sole correctness guarantee.

**Risk envelope:** if the cascade analysis is wrong on any of those 13
rules, the regression only surfaces once a real user seeds threads.
Most-likely regression shapes: author-identity tints disappear or shift
(sky-blue base instead of tone-N color), per-tone reply backgrounds
flatten, lane-side dot markers vanish, `.feedback-click-reply.is-target`
loses its selected-ring chrome.

**Entry point:** seed a fixture `app/users/feedback-board.json` with
2-3 threads (different `tone-N` classes, mixed `is-left`/`is-right`
reply lanes, at least one `.feedback-thread-click-target` clicked into
`is-target`). Add `14b-feedback-board-populated` view that loads the
fixture and captures the rendered board. Then re-run G.3.2's
visual-diff against the populated baseline as a retroactive empirical
check. If the deletions hold up, this stays a one-time validation; if
any view regresses, the affected rules get restored.

**Shipped in PR #69 (2026-06-23):** Fixture seeded via filesystem path
`tools/fixtures/feedback-board.populated.json`. View 14b uses
`seedFeedbackFixture` + `restoreFeedbackBoard` helpers (test-utils.js,
content-comparison safety to prevent dev-data loss + tools/.harness-state/
backup dir). Captures 2 threads + 6 replies covering tone-0..5,
both `is-left`/`is-right` lanes carrying `replyTo` (for
`.feedback-reply-context` chrome on both lanes), `.feedback-reply.is-target`
(via Charlie's reply click) + `.feedback-thread-body.is-target` (via
thread 2's body click). Note: `.feedback-thread-click-target.is-target`
is UNREACHABLE — setFeedbackReplyTarget's `[data-feedback-reply-anchor="${target.id}"]`
lookup doesn't match the thread-head div's `data-feedback-reply-anchor="thread"`
literal anchor. Documented in view 14b setup comment.

TZ + locale pinned via `chromium.newContext({ timezoneId: 'UTC',
locale: 'en-US' })` so `formatFeedbackTime` (toLocaleString) renders
deterministically across runners.

### 9b — DEFERRED: G.3.2 commit message precision

PR #64 commit message says the FINAL FEEDBACK AUTHOR COLOR LOCK
`--author-soft/-mid/-line` declarations were "shadowed by FEEDBACK
AUTHOR TONE LOCK identical declarations." TONE LOCK's values
(0.11/0.24/0.40) actually differ from FINAL LOCK's (0.10/0.22/0.42)
by 0.01-0.02. The deletion is behaviorally safe because TONE LOCK
wins by source order regardless, but the word "identical" is imprecise.

**Consequence (per altitude reviewer):** A future reader trusting the
"identical" phrasing might assume the TONE LOCK block is also a
duplicate and silently shift tints by 0.01-0.02 across every author
bubble.

**Entry point:** if Phase 4 ever touches the TONE LOCK block, verify
the value-diff before treating it as a duplicate of FINAL LOCK.

### 9c — MIXED: opened-mistake-case view (SHIPPED PR #70) + narrow-viewport (DEFERRED)

Identified during PR #65 (Step G.3.3) adversarial review on 2026-06-22.

**Coverage gap 1 — view 03 mistake-notebook never opens a case. SHIPPED PR #70 (2026-06-23).**
View 03 (`03-mistake-notebook`) only captures the landing surface. It
does not click a case to open `.mistake-workspace`, so the
`.mistake-workspace` (display + grid-template-columns), `.mistake-ai-
instruction` (min-height), and `.mistake-note-columns` (min-height +
height + grid-template-rows) deletions in PR #65 are NOT pixel-
validated. Cascade analysis is the sole correctness guarantee for
these 3 deletions:

- `.mistake-workspace` candidate shadowed by EARLIER doubled-
  `#mistakeNotebookView#mistakeNotebookView .mistake-workspace` at
  strictly higher specificity (0,2,1,0 vs 0,1,1,0) — always wins
- `.mistake-ai-instruction min-height: 94px` shadowed by same-spec
  later rule with min-height: 96px
- `.mistake-note-columns` first declaration shadowed by same-spec
  later declaration with different clamp values

**Entry point:** add a `03b-mistake-notebook-open-case` view that
seeds a fixture mistake case (`app/users/mistakes.json` or similar),
opens it, and captures the workspace. Then re-run all 3 deletions
against the populated baseline as a retroactive empirical check.

**Shipped in PR #70 (2026-06-23):** View 03b seeds
`localStorage[aquariusMistakeNotebook.v1]` with a single fixture
mistake (id, title, tags, notes, empty arrays + empty AI fields,
`problemText` only — no `imageDataUrl` to avoid embedding a raster
blob). Two of the three PR #65 deletes are pixel-validated; the third
(`.mistake-ai-instruction`) was verified ORPHAN — no DOM ever matches
the selector (grep against `index.html` + `app.js` + `mistake-notebook.js`
returns zero rendering paths). Cannot be pixel-validated by any harness
coverage.

**Side-discovery from PR #70 diagnostic instrumentation:** view 04
(`04-recent-conversations`) setup's `page.click('#mistakeNotebookCloseBtn')`
has been silently failing since the harness was created. The button is
hidden by the doubled-ID rule at `app/style.css:34394` (`display: none
!important; visibility: hidden !important; width: 0 !important; ...`).
Playwright's click times out, the `.catch(() => {})` swallows the error,
the subsequent `waitForSelector('#mistakeNotebookView.hidden')` also
silently times out. View 04 has ALWAYS captured mistake-notebook view
+ sidebar recent-panel open, NOT welcomeScreen. Real production
implication: this might be a user-visible UX bug (clicking ✕ on the
mistake notebook should close it, but it cannot be clicked — though
users probably navigate away via the sidebar nav anyway). Documented
in view 04 setup; a future PR could fix the visibility rule + rebaseline
view 04. Tracked here for visibility.

03b is scheduled at the END of the Page A view list (after view 25)
rather than adjacent to view 03. Reason: with 03b preceding view 04,
view 04's broken close-button click leaves mistake-notebook in the
POPULATED state (workspace visible), causing a ~4.2% drift on view 04's
"mistake-notebook empty + recent panel open" baseline. Running 03b at
end means no Page A view inherits the populated state. View 03's
INVARIANT comment documents this constraint for future contributors.

**Coverage gap 2 — narrow-viewport @media never captured.**
Harness viewport is 1280x800 (`tools/visual-diff.js` L42, > 1180px).
The `@media (max-width: 1180px) #preferenceView .preference-page-grid`
deletion in PR #65 is INVISIBLE to the harness. Cascade-shadow
analysis confirmed the rule is dead (later same-query block with
identical selector + property set wins by source order), but no
pixel-diff can validate.

**Entry point:** either add a separate narrow-viewport visual-diff
sweep (run at 800x600 or similar against all preference / chapter
overview / responsive surfaces), or document that ALL `@media (max-
width)` deletions are cascade-only-verified for future sub-PR reviews.

**Status (2026-06-23): DOCUMENTATION-ONLY CLOSE.** No separate
narrow-viewport sweep is planned. Future cascade-shadow work that
touches `@media (max-width: ...)` rules at `app/style.css:36230`
(`#preferenceView .preference-page-grid` at ≤1180px),
`app/style.css:38335` (`.mistake-note-columns { grid-template-columns:
1fr }` at ≤980px), `app/style.css:36240` (notebook-shell padding at
≤820px), and the broader `@media` cluster from L11000+ MUST treat
those deletions as cascade-only-verified — the 1280×800 fixed harness
viewport cannot pixel-validate them. Cascade-shadow analysis (specificity
tuples + source order + !important precedence on the same selector)
is the sole correctness guarantee. If a future round of CSS deletion
proposes a narrow-viewport @media block as dead, surface it explicitly
in the PR description as "cascade-shadow only, no harness coverage."

Implementing the actual sweep would need: (a) a parallel BrowserContext
at a narrow viewport (e.g. 800×800 to also cover ≤820 + ≤980 breakpoints
in one width), (b) a curated subset of views that exercise responsive
surfaces (preference, course-tracker, mistake-notebook, feedback-board
— roughly 6-10 views), (c) new baselines + signal-handling. ~150-line
implementation, ~half-session of work. Worth doing only if a future
Phase 4 cascade-shadow round proposes 5+ @media deletions in one PR.

## 10. Phase 3.5 v5 follow-up (state-variant harness gaps closed)

Drafted 2026-06-24 after PRs #83 + #84 landed.

PR #83 closed the 3 sev3 latent blind spots flagged in §3b.iv.followup:

- **View 12e (`12e-preference-primary-btn-active`)** — `page.mouse.down()`
  over `#preferenceSaveBtn` bounding box, asserts the
  `matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1)` (+1px translateY) from L35563's `:active`
  rule. STRICT_FAIL_RATIO = 0.05%.
- **View 14f (`14f-feedback-input-focused`)** — focuses
  `#feedbackTitleInput` so the L37095 grouped selector's
  `.feedback-input` arm is pixel-covered (view 14d only exercised the
  `.feedback-textarea` arm). STRICT_FAIL_RATIO = 0.05%.
- **View 14d outline assert** — added `outline-style/-width/-color`
  computed-style probe so a deletion of L37095's `outline: none
  !important` (or the L9405 broad reset that backs it up) would
  fail-fast on the assertion rather than waiting for a pixel-diff
  fluke. See [[reference-feedback-input-outline-cascade]] for the
  cascade rationale.

PR #84 (§3b.iv pass 2) shipped −42 lines bundled with PR #83's harness
work — all 4 deleted blocks were verified safe by the new state-variant
views.

No remaining items in §10. State-variant harness coverage on the
preference primary-btn / secondary-btn / editor / feedback compose
input + textarea / feedback-board thread bodies is complete for the
35-view bar set today.

## 11. Lesson + mistake-notebook baseline refresh (Phase 3.5 v6) — SHIPPED PR #86 (2026-06-24)

**Drafted 2026-06-24.** Discovered while planning a "should we refresh
the drifted baselines?" PR. **Shipped 2026-06-24 in PR #86** via
Option A (mask `#sidebarSyllabusPanel` with `display: none` from view
06 onward on Page A) + refresh of the 9 affected baselines. Verified
by 5 consecutive `--check` runs all 35/35 green. View 22 still shows
~0.3% cold-cache flake (§11a) under the 0.5% default threshold.

### Root cause

9 baselines drift consistently at 1.3-1.4% on every `--check` run
(reproduced 2× on clean post-PR-#83/#84 main, commit 48fdddc):

| View | Drift (px) | Drift (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 06-lesson-view | 13645 / 1024000 | 1.333% |
| 07-lesson-pager-states | 13645 | 1.333% |
| 08-lesson-lecture-toolbar | 13645 | 1.333% |
| 09-lesson-qa-column | 13645 | 1.333% |
| 15-lesson-chapter-overview | 13645 | 1.333% |
| 16-lesson-chapter-overview-split | 13645 | 1.333% |
| 21-lesson-key-takeaways | 13715 | 1.339% |
| 22-lesson-quick-check | 13706 (±~0.4% extra cold-cache flake) | 1.338% |
| 03b-mistake-notebook-open-case | 14100 | 1.377% |

All 9 share the same root cause: the **left sidebar's vertical
layout shifted ~1-2px per row** between the baseline capture (PR #70,
commit 9c2329b on 2026-06-22) and HEAD (commit 48fdddc on 2026-06-24).
Diff inspection (`tools/visual-diff/06-lesson-view.png`) shows
overlapping `Background` / `Chapter 1 (Signals and Systems)` /
`1.1 Size of a Signal` text at the same horizontal position but
offset vertically — exactly the signature of a per-row padding /
line-height / margin shift accumulating down the list.

Source: 9 cascade-shadow-removal PRs landed between PR #70 and HEAD
(#71 −95, #74 −54, #76 −11, #77 −16, #79 −30, #80 −48, #81 −41,
#82 +13, #83 −42). Every one was adversarial-reviewed and harness-
verified at 0.000% on its **then-current baseline set**, but no PR
re-baselined the lesson-page sidebar surface. The accumulated
rounding error is the visible drift.

**MEMORY mischaracterization correction:**
[[project-phase3-status]] Step G.3 finding #3 claims this is a
"first-run cold-cache sidebar flake" that resolves on the second
`--check` run. Falsified 2026-06-24: both runs land at identical
pixel counts on the deterministic views (06/07/08/09/15/16 = 13645
px exactly, 03b = 14100 px exactly, 21 = 13715 px stable, 22 = 13706
px ±~0.4% extra cold-cache flake on the quick-check rendering only).
The "run twice" mitigation never worked on these views — it papered
over a real drift.

### Why deferred (defer rule D2 — Harness blindspot)

The baseline files are STALE artifacts, not a code problem. Refreshing
them is the right move *iff* every shipped PR (#71-#83) actually was
safe on the rendering surface it claimed not to affect. That assumption
holds: each PR's cascade-shadow analysis cited the specific later-source
or higher-specificity rule that wins after deletion, and all 35 views
remained green against their then-current baselines. The drift is
expected layout micro-shift, not a real regression.

### Plan (REVISED 2026-06-24 after attempted fix in PR #85)

**Original plan: baseline-only PR.** Refuted on first attempt — the
captures themselves are non-deterministic across runs, so any baseline
becomes immediately stale.

**Attempt 1 — PR #85 (closed unmerged):** added
`normalizeSidebarSyllabusScroll(page)` helper in `tools/test-utils.js`
called at the end of `openSubtopic`. Pinned scrollTop=0 on
`#sidebarSyllabusPanel` + `.sidebar-syllabus-panel-inner` + every
scrollable descendant. Also tried (in later iteration) `waitForFunction`
on `.is-animating` clearing, and double-rAF settle. Result: REDUCED
drift from ~13645 px to ~12379 px but did NOT eliminate it. Three
consecutive `--check` runs produced different MD5s on the same code:

| Run | View 06 px-diff | View 22 px-diff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 12379 | 16136 |
| 2 | 12379 (vs Run-1 baseline) | 12423 |
| 3 | 13346 (vs Run-2 baseline) | 12423 |

The two-state-attractor hypothesis (oscillation between two specific
post-openSubtopic sidebar layouts) is partly explained but not fully
characterized — even between two runs with identical-MD5 captures, a
third run flips to a different state. Closed PR #85 without merging
2026-06-24.

### Real root cause hypothesis (next-session entry point)

The drift is in the sidebar's vertical layout — `tools/visual-diff/06-*.png`
diff inspection shows sidebar text rendered at slightly different
vertical positions, NOT lesson content drift. Three contributors,
ordered by likelihood:

1. **Chapter accordion height jitter.** `setAccordionOpen` at
   `app.js:522` uses `max-height` transition that ends with
   `.is-animating` removed, but the FINAL height depends on the
   transition's animation phase quantization at the moment the
   transition-end listener fires. Subpixel rounding produces ±1 px on
   the panel's settled height, which shifts every sidebar row below
   it.
2. **Font subpixel hinting variance.** Chromium's font rasterization is
   not bit-exact deterministic across BrowserContext fresh-starts even
   with same font + same DPI. May explain the high-frequency 1-2 px
   row-by-row offset across the whole sidebar.
3. **MathJax typeset re-flow.** `settleLesson` waits for
   `MathJax.typesetPromise`, but only at the CALLER time — if MathJax
   does deferred work after settle resolves, layout can re-shift
   after the screenshot.

### Revised plan

Three options, in order of ambition:

**Option A — Mask the sidebar entirely on lesson views.** Add a
`PER_VIEW_MASKS['06-lesson-view'] = '#sidebarSyllabusPanel * { visibility: hidden !important }'`
(and same for 07/08/09/15/16/21/22/03b). The harness then ignores
sidebar pixel state for these views, focuses on lesson chrome
correctness. Loses sidebar regression coverage on lesson views; gains
back to other views (12-preference etc.) which already cover sidebar
rendering separately. **~15 line PR, fixes drift, ships in 30 min.**

**Option B — Replace settleLesson's MathJax wait with a layout-stable
sentinel.** Have app.js emit a `document.documentElement.dataset.lessonLayoutStable = '1'`
attribute after MathJax + chapter accordion + scrollIntoViewIfNeeded
have ALL fully resolved (probably gated on `requestIdleCallback` +
2× rAF). settleLesson waits for that attribute instead of inferring
from MathJax + rAFs. Heavier — needs app.js instrumentation. **~60
line PR across app.js + test-utils.js, ships in 1-2h.**

**Option C — Per-view loose threshold.** Set per-view
`failRatio = 0.015` (1.5%) on the 9 lesson views. Mechanical;
deceives the harness into "passing" with deeply-degraded coverage.
**Not recommended** — defeats the purpose of regression coverage on
exactly the surface where Phase 3 cascade work happens.

**Recommendation:** Option A is the cheapest reasonable fix. The
sidebar rendering is exercised by views 12/13/14 (preference,
course-tracker, feedback-board) which all show the sidebar in
deterministic resting states. Lesson views care about lesson chrome,
not sidebar chrome.

### Why ultimately deferred (defer rule D2 — Harness blindspot)

Each option needs harness expansion + verification + per-view
threshold tuning. Out of scope for a baseline-only PR. Schedule as
its own focused session.

### 11a — DEFERRED follow-up: view 22 cold-cache ~0.4% flake

View 22 (`22-lesson-quick-check`) shows ~0.4% additional pixel drift
on the first `--check` of a session vs subsequent runs. Likely
quick-check-KP-specific (probably KaTeX render or
`advanceLessonUntil(#testBannerCard)` sentinel timing). Subsumed by
the §11 main investigation if Option B above is pursued (Option A
also masks it via sidebar-hidden; Option C absorbs it via loose
threshold).

## 12. Phase 3.6 entry — step-1/step-2 status + structural-attack kickoff (2026-06-24 night)

AFK overnight session. FlyM1ss authorized pushing past the §3c.i/§3b
tail and the state-variant harness into the big structural attack (the
`!important` wall + `#learnView#learnView` doubled-ID pattern), per
`docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md` "The right sequence from here".

### Fresh ground-truth metrics (2026-06-24 night, `grep -c` on HEAD)

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| `app/style.css` lines | 42,991 |
| lines containing `!important` (style.css) | 14,948 (15,140 occurrences) |
| doubled-ID `#X#X` selectors (style.css) | 608 |
| — of which `#learnView#learnView` | 353 |
| tripled-ID `#X#X#X` (style.css) | 91 (49 are `#learnView`×3) |
| `runtime-collapsed.css` lines / `!important` / `#learnView` sels | 2,102 / 1,158 / 525 |

The doubled-ID debt is ~600/608 concentrated in the **learn-view
reading subsystem** (`#learnView` 353, `#learnBody` 62, `#learnChatCol`
36, `#learnLecturePageIndicator` 23, `#learnFollowupBar` 21,
`#learnChatContent` 13, `#learnExplainBottomRail` 11, …) plus
`#textbookFocusModal` 32. So the "`#learnView#learnView` attack" is a
learn-view + textbook-focus surface rewrite.

### Step 1 (§3c.i / §3b tail) — CONFIRMED AT D3 CEILING, no standalone PR

§3c.i pass 8 (commit c45b205) found zero whole-rule candidates; the
home-Ask shadowed-banner vein is mined out under the current
delete-only discipline. The only remaining slivers are themselves
doubled-ID / grouped-selector-split work and fold into Phase 3.6:
- §3c.i pass 9: split the HOME ASK LIQUID GLASS TEST 4-arm grouped
  selector (now L30011, banner L29910) to drop the 2 shadowed arms
  (~12 lines).
- §3b.iii: MN doubled-ID specificity patterns (L35492-area).
Forcing a standalone step-1 PR would violate "don't invent the next
step" — recorded as at-ceiling; the slivers are absorbed by the
Phase 3.6 surface sweep.

### Step 2 (state-variant harness) — COMPLETE; learn-view PROBE coverage is the new need

Per §10, state-variant coverage (`:hover`/`:focus`/`:active`/`:disabled`
on the #20b/#20c top selectors) is complete in the 36-view set. The
harness work Phase 3.6 actually needs is **learn-view computed-style-probe
coverage** — the regression net for the doubled-ID/`!important` collapse,
since pixel-diff has documented property-specific blindspots
(§3a.i #feedbackView). Shipping as its own PR → main.

### Step 3 (Phase 3.6 structural attack) — see docs/PHASE3.6_SPEC.md

Spec authored from a parallel inventory workflow. Cross-file finding
(extends §3d): `runtime-collapsed.css` ALSO uses doubled/tripled IDs;
style.css's `#learnView`×3 triples (49) exist to out-rank them — the
ID-multiplication is a CROSS-FILE specificity arms race, not within-file
cruft. `#textbookFocusModal` has ZERO `runtime-collapsed.css` competitor
(grep-confirmed 0) → self-contained pilot. Execution on branch
`refactor/phase3.6-css-collapse`; single massive PR only when complete,
else branch-only (no PR) per FlyM1ss's AFK instruction.

## 13. Phase 3.6 verification harness `tools/css-probe.js` — SHIPPED PR #101 (2026-06-24)

The computed-style probe gate for the Phase 3.6 collapse (docs/PHASE3.6_SPEC.md
§4). Table-driven `getComputedStyle` snapshots (`--baseline` / `--check`,
byte-identical), spawns its own bridge on `:9126`. States S2/S3 (§3d
composer-chain baseline) + S12 (textbook pilot gate). Wired into `npm run check`
(node --check) + `test:css-probe:{baseline,check}` scripts.

A medium-effort `/code-review` (10 agents) caught the worst defect class for a
verification harness — **false confidence** — all fixed before merge:
- FAIL CLOSED on absence-of-signal (`--baseline` refuses `__MISSING__`; `--check`
  fails on `__MISSING__`/`__ABSENT__` baseline, vanished element, corrupt
  (non-array) baseline state, current-only probe, current-only state, duplicate key).
- Probe LITERAL cascade values, not layout-derived USED values (dropped
  `width`/`grid-template-columns` — drift across machines/fonts/scrollbars and
  non-discriminating <820px; kept min-height/border-radius/bg-image/box-shadow/
  backdrop-filter).
- Render the `.textbook-focus-qa-empty` node in S12 (was JS-only → dead probe).
- Dropped non-discriminating page-indicator `::before/::after` probes.
- assert-as-entered sentinels (R8): S2/S3 `min-height===152px`; S12 glass-token +
  panel `border-radius:24px`.
A 1-agent adversarial re-review confirmed no new defects.

### 13a — DEFERRED (D1): hoist bridge/mask/report machinery shared with visual-diff.js

**Status: deferred 2026-06-24 in PR #101 (defer rule D1).**

**What:** the bridge-spawn + SIGTERM-race teardown + signal handler + MASK
`addInitScript` injection + markdown-report assembly in `tools/css-probe.js` are
near-duplicates of `tools/visual-diff.js`. They will drift (a fix in one won't
reach the other — e.g. the PR #69 #9 orphaned-bridge fix).

**Why deferred (D1 — Unrelated module):** the fix's center of gravity is the
stable, load-bearing `tools/visual-diff.js`; hoisting `spawnBridge()` +
`injectMask(context)` + a `writeReport()` into `tools/test-utils.js` and rewiring
BOTH harnesses needs a visual-diff regression run (35-view `--check`), which is
out of scope for a probe-harness PR.

**Next-session entry point:** `tools/test-utils.js` — add `spawnBridge(repoRoot, port)`,
`injectMaskInitScript(context)`, `writeMarkdownReport(path, {title, rows})`; rewire
`tools/css-probe.js` + `tools/visual-diff.js`; verify with `npm run test:visual:check`
+ `npm run test:css-probe:check`. ~1 focused PR.

### 13b — accepted limitation: baseline-driven coverage

The harness compares the current run against the committed baseline; coverage is
whatever the baseline records. Adding a new probe STATE requires re-baselining
(the §13 symmetric guard now errors on a current-only state so the gap is loud,
not silent). Same design as `visual-diff.js`. When Surface 6 (§3d composer chain)
is attacked, add states S4-S11 (spec §4.2) and re-baseline on pre-collapse main.

## 14. The redeclaration-pileup `!important` lever — TOP-LEVEL SLICE EXECUTED; media-gated slice DEFERRED (D2)

**Status: prereq 1 (narrow harness) DONE 2026-06-25; prereq 2 (hardened parser) BUILT + self-reviewed 2026-06-25; TOP-LEVEL slice EXECUTED on branch `refactor/phase3.6-css-collapse` in PR #105 (style.css −3,631 dead / −2,844 `!important`; rcc −68 / −68; + empty husks −509 style / −12 rcc); MEDIA-GATED slice (78 style + 6 rcc decls) remains DEFERRED (D2 — harness blindspot). The xhigh self-review caught the detector over-deleting 48 decls and was fixed before merge (see below).**

**Update 2026-06-25 (pass 2) — prereq 2 built + self-reviewed, finding corrected, top-level slice executed.**

The correctness-hardened parser is built: `tools/find-dead-redeclarations.js` (character-level
state machine; comment/string/paren-dataURI/brace aware; correct push/pop `@`-context stack;
`@keyframes`/`@font-face` opaque). Its self-contained `--validate` runs 17 synthetic edge-case
assertions (incl. every fixed bug class); wired into `npm run check`. Building it **corrected
§14's central finding**: the throwaway detector's never-pop `@`-context bug had reported "0 of 696
dead are top-level — all media-gated." The truth is the **opposite** — **3,631 of 3,709 dead
declarations (~98%) are TOP-LEVEL** (desktop-verifiable, never actually D2-blocked) and only **78
are media-gated** (style.css; +6 in rcc). The top-level slice was swept + the empty `sel { }`
husks it left behind removed (5 of which eliminated doubled-ID selectors outright).

*Verification (four independent layers, all green):* (a) a **winner-preservation differential**
(parser groups before vs after) confirmed **16,610/16,610 (style) + 887/887 (rcc) groups
preserved, 0 winning values changed, 0 vanished**, idempotent (0 top-level dead remaining); (b)
css-probe `--check` byte-identical, 9 states / 76 probes; (c) visual-diff `--check`, all 35 views
pass (the only non-zero diffs are a stable 38px on `12-preference-page`, present identically
pre/post collapse, and lesson views that flake 0↔hundreds across repeated runs of the SAME file —
content non-determinism from the keyless `/api/section` fallback, not the change).

*Two real bugs caught BEFORE merge, both by the layered verification, not the harness alone:*
(1) the winner-preservation differential caught a comment-offset excision bug (a comment between
`;` and a property name pushed the decl span into it, deleting a `*/` and commenting-out 103
`:root` groups) — fixed (67af365) by tracking real source offsets. (2) The xhigh self-review of
PR #105 caught the detector **over-deleting 48 declarations**: it grouped by only the innermost
selector, but `app/style.css` has an **accidentally-unclosed `.learn-followup-bar {`** (empty body
+ comment) at the "Final lecture typography override" block (source ~L6810), so nesting-aware
browsers scope the 79 following decls under it; the old grouping merged them with the top-level
`.explain-body` typography and deleted 48. Fixed (772c065) by grouping on the full nesting chain
(`parent >> child`); the collapse was re-run (18d77ce). **The committed result was render-neutral
in Chromium anyway (visual-diff passed), but the deletion was premised on a mis-modeled structure
— shipping the conservative fixed result instead.** ⚠️ The unclosed `.learn-followup-bar {` is a
PRE-EXISTING SOURCE BUG (likely makes those overrides inert globally in nesting browsers) — flagged
for a separate cascade-changing fix, NOT touched here.

*Why the media-gated 78 stay D2:* the visual-diff harness renders only at desktop 1280 (cannot
observe any <1280 decl), and the css-probe narrow states probe just 3 selectors
(`.learn-explain-toolbar`, `.learn-toolbar-center`, `.learn-body`) — the 78 media-gated dead decls
sit overwhelmingly on UNprobed selectors (home-ask, feedback, login, mistake-notebook,
chapter-overview, settings) and in contexts the harness can't reach (`@media (max-width:560px)`,
`@container lecture-panel`, `prefers-reduced-motion`). Deleting them now would be "flying blind in
the narrow-viewport blindspot" exactly as warned below. Reward is marginal (~78 lines / 72
`!important`) vs the ~5,300-line top-level+husk win already banked; unblocking needs the harness
expansion in the next-session entry point. The cascade theorem + winner-preservation say they ARE
dead, but the agreed bar for this lever requires browser-observable verification per band.

*(Original deferral analysis below — retained for the prerequisite list and the media-unaware-trap evidence.)*

**Update 2026-06-25 — prerequisite 1 satisfied + a correction to the analysis below.**

*Narrow-viewport harness (prereq 1) is now in place.* `tools/css-probe.js` gained an optional
per-state `viewport:{width,height}` field and four narrow learn-chrome states — N1@1160 (inside
the ≤1180 band), N2@890 (≤900), N3@740 (≤820, also ≤760), N4@700 (≤720) — pinning only LITERAL
cascade values (toolbar `grid-template-areas` + `flex-wrap`, toolbar-center `flex-wrap`, and the
inherited `--learn-edge-tab-top` px custom property). The clamp()/cqi toolbar-center `gap`
(17.92→16.24→12.46px) is deliberately NOT probed — it is a layout-derived used value that drifts
across machines. Re-baselined on pre-collapse main; `--check` is byte-identical across two
independent runs; a negative control (neutralizing the ≤900 `flex-wrap:wrap !important` rule at
`app/style.css` L12999) is caught by three states (N2's sentinel + N3/N4 probe diffs), proving
the harness detects exactly the width-gated deletions this lever performs. **KNOWN GAP (recorded,
not covered):** chapter-overview book-spread (≤1120/≤760), lecture-overlay nav buttons
(≤1320/≤900), and collapsed-panel edge tabs (≤900) are absent from a §1.1-1 lesson DOM, and
`runtime-collapsed.css` responsiveness keys off `@container lecture-panel` (the explain-panel's
own width, not the viewport) — covering them needs a chapter-overview lesson state and/or a
container-width driver, a follow-up harness task.

*CORRECTION to "dominated by `@media (max-width:1024px)` (~150 dead)" below (verified on HEAD).*
There is exactly ONE `@media (max-width:1024px)` block in `app/style.css` (L912–939) and it
touches ZERO learn-chrome rules and ZERO `!important` — it only restyles `.intro-landing-new`
(landing hero / ui-mockup / constellation). The ~150 dead decls the throwaway detector attributed
to 1024px are actually **top-level** (brace depth 0): the "Edge tabs v3 → v6 final-final"
redeclaration pileup at L941–L1030+ (`.learn-body` custom props + `.learn-explain-toggle-btn` /
`#learnFocusBtn` / `.learn-side-restore-*` redeclared across successive "vN" rewrites). The buggy
`@`-context stack never popped the 1024px context after L939, so it mis-labeled top-level dead
decls as media-gated. **Consequence: a material (still-unquantified) fraction of the 696 is
desktop-visible and was never actually D2-blocked** — it is verifiable by the EXISTING 1280
harness and can be swept now, separately from the media-gated slice. The true narrow-viewport
learn-chrome bands are 1180/1120/900/820/760/720 (inside-media `!important` load
47/36/99/67/108/64), NOT 1024. The exact top-level-vs-media split awaits prerequisite 2 (the
hardened parser).

**What:** `app/style.css` carries the "FINAL/EOF/LOCK" redeclaration-pileup pattern the
spec §0 named: the *same selector* sets the *same property* in multiple rule blocks within
the *same `@media`/`@supports` context*; only the last block wins, so every earlier
same-property declaration is provably dead (cascade-neutral to delete). An importance- and
media-context-aware detector (built 2026-06-25, run on HEAD) found **696 such dead
declarations across 179 selectors, of which 620 are `!important`.** This is the single
largest remaining `!important`-count lever in the file — bigger than any dead-orphan sweep.

**Why deferred (D2 — verification needs harness expansion first):** a context-aware split
showed **0 of the 696 are top-level — every one lives inside a media query**, dominated by
`@media (max-width: 1024px)` (~150 dead) with a long tail down to ~430–600px. The css-probe
+ visual-diff harnesses both render at **desktop width (1280)**, so they cannot observe any
of these declarations — deleting them now would be flying blind in exactly the
narrow-viewport blindspot spec §4 warns about. A naive (media-unaware) detector reported
4,422 "dead" decls; **3,726 of those were responsive/theme overrides that would have BROKEN
if deleted** (e.g. `:root[data-theme="dark"]` vars redefined per breakpoint) — proof that
this lever is a trap without viewport-aware verification.

**Two hard prerequisites before this is safe to execute:**
1. **Narrow-viewport harness coverage.** Add css-probe STATES (and ideally visual-diff views)
   that render the affected learn-view chrome at ≤1024px (and a second tier ~760px and ~560px
   to cover the tail), probing the literal cascade value of each property a deleted decl
   touched. Re-baseline on pre-collapse main. This is a Step-2 (per-PR-to-main) task and is
   the concrete unblocker.
2. **A correctness-hardened parser.** The throwaway detector's `@`-context *stack* over-
   accumulates conditions across sibling blocks (errs safe for counting — under-groups, so
   696 is a LOWER bound — but unfit for deletion). The deletion pass needs a brace-accurate
   parser that pops context correctly and handles comments/`content:"}"`/data-URIs. Validate
   it against the spec's known ground truth (`.learn-explain-toggle-btn` height redeclared
   11× at (0,1,0)) before trusting it to cut.

**Next-session entry point (media-gated slice only — the top-level slice is DONE on branch):**
the 78 remaining media-gated dead decls need harness expansion before they are safe to cut:
(1) add per-selector css-probe narrow probes covering the media-gated selectors (home-ask /
feedback / login / mistake-notebook / chapter-overview / settings families — run
`node tools/find-dead-redeclarations.js app/style.css --media --json` for the exact list);
(2) add a `@container lecture-panel` panel-width driver state (the 10 `@container` decls key off
the explain-panel's own width, not the viewport — the documented §15 follow-up); (3) add a ≤560px
css-probe state (the `@media (max-width:560px)` 4 decls). Then
`node tools/find-dead-redeclarations.js app/style.css --write --media` on the branch and re-verify
winner-preservation + css-probe `--check` byte-identical + visual-diff. Est. remaining reward:
~72 `!important` + ~78 lines (marginal — the 98% top-level bulk is already banked).

## 15. css-probe S2/S3 panelFocus JS-var desync — DEFERRED (D1), harness-fidelity only

**Status: deferred 2026-06-25 in PR #104 self-review (defer rule D1 — pre-existing, unrelated to this PR's diff).**

**What:** The S2/S3 desktop probe states (PR #101) set `#learnBody.dataset.panelFocus =
'qa-wide'|'qa-full'` directly in `page.evaluate` instead of calling the app's internal
`applyLearnPanelFocusState` (app.js), so the module-internal `learnPanelFocus` JS variable stays
`'normal'`. With the DOM in a panel-focus state but the JS var `'normal'`, `applyLearnSplit`'s
guard (`learnPanelFocus !== 'normal'`, app.js ~L7561) is false at desktop width, so it RUNS and
writes inline `!important` split-column styles onto the shared learn columns; the desync persists
across later states on the shared page.

**Why deferred (D1):** the finding is in the S2/S3 `enter()` logic (PR #101), which this PR's diff
did not touch — the new banded states N0–N4 are independent. It is invisible to the harness: no
probe (FOLLOWUP_PROBES / NARROW_PROBES / S12) reads `learnPanelFocus` or the inline split-column
geometry it produces, so no captured value is affected (confirmed: `--check` byte-identical, 8/8
states). A proper fix needs app.js to expose `applyLearnPanelFocusState` to the page context (or
the harness to replicate its full side-effect set) AND would re-capture + potentially drift the
S2/S3 baseline — out of scope for a harness-coverage PR.

**Next-session entry point:** `tools/css-probe.js` S2/S3 `enter()` (`shell.dataset.panelFocus = …`);
`app.js` `applyLearnPanelFocusState` / the `applyLearnSplit` guard (~L2725 / ~L7561). Only worth
fixing if a future probe targets the learn-split column geometry. Est. effort: small, gated on
exposing the app function + an S2/S3 re-baseline.

> PR #104 self-review note: the other review findings were fixed in-PR — desktop bracket state N0
> (catches a media-query hoist that changes the 1280 value), an `explain-collapsed` floor in
